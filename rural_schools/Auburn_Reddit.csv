bjwg5c,Potential transfer student questions,"Hey there, I’m looking at potentially transferring into Auburn in Fall of 2020. 

Context: Auburn was my dream school but out of state. Accepted out of HS, but chose cheaper in state school. Withdrew, bounced around a few schools, jobs, etc. Spent 18-20 acting like a 18-20 year old. Currently moved to Birmingham a few months ago to work full time and gain residency. 

My questions: Around the time I’ll be looking to transfer in I’ll have 2.5-3.0ish GPA. I know 2.5 is the requirement. I’ll also have 10 (I know) W’s on my transcript. How hard is it getting accepted as a transfer? Will those W’s destroy me?

Also, I’m currently working full time, renting in Birmingham by myself, have AL drivers license, etc. Is there anything else I can be doing or need to be doing to help with gaining residency? I’m in school but taking part time hours so that shouldn’t be an issue per Auburn website.

bkex6m,I hate my apartment complex,"2 years ago I signed a lease at the social on longleaf drive and I had an alright experience but had a dispute with them because they charged me rent that I didn’t owe. The next year I signed a lease at the beacon which was good but they had terrible internet but the social had good internet. So I mistakenly signed a lease again. 3 months into my lease, the Social was under new management. After the change in management, for some reason a bunch of shady people starting coming to the complex.  There was a shooting outside my building in March and the power hungry management team  responded by implementing very strict parking rules that are not needed. The complex never issued us guest parking passes in the first place. They complain about non residents parking in guest spaces when they never gave their residents guest parking passes which would have cleared that problem to begin with. Most apartment complexes issue their residents one parking pass and a guest pass but not the social! It doesn’t matter if your friends or family come to visit and they leave their car for 49 hours, they will tow it. They obviously had massive resident backlash from this policy otherwise they wouldn’t have sent out an email basically giving their own residents the finger. last time I checked, Adults live here not children so management should stop treating us like children. These parking rules didn’t even stop crime from happening over here, police were called twice in 2 weeks and I saw someone getting arrested outside and apparently, some people were breaking into cars but nothing was taken because some other residents scared them off. Thank god its May because I cannot wait to move out of here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/bkex6m/i_hate_my_apartment_complex/,Aldebarannnn,28,2019-05-03 19:25:31,9,/r/auburn/comments/bkex6m/i_hate_my_apartment_complex/
bkgch0,Good news guys! Susan Kiechel (founder of our women's soccer team) has started the treatment she needs to save her life!,"Hey everyone! I've posted here several times about my mom, Susan Kiechel. She is the founder of our women's soccer team, and we have been fundraising so she can get a life-saving treatment. 

Her full story is [here](https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/11/an-auburn-family-calls-for-help)

Finally, she has started her stem cell transplant!!!! This treatment will take about a month, and they basically reset her immune system to get rid of her autoimmune disease.

Without this treatment, she would probably die in a few more months. So, thank you all to everyone who offered support by donating or just sharing her story. Without you, my mom wouldn't have the chance to finally beat this disease after 18 long years. War Damn Eagle!

blyzve,Advice to incoming freshman from a recent graduate.,"I graduated last Sunday  I just wanted to give some words of encouragement to any incoming freshmen who just so happened to stumble upon this post.  First of all, never give up. There were many occasions where I felt like I was never going to graduate and I would drop out but in the end I’m so glad I stuck with it because graduation is the best feeling in the world after putting in all of the hard work. It’s going to pay off trust me. Second of all, get involved! Do Greek life or join a club if it isn’t your thing. The number one thing I could take back was not getting involved enough because it creates the opportunity to meet people that you will have connections with for the rest of your life. If you are into sports, Go to as many football games as possible because being a student and watching your school play on Saturdays in the sec is unlike any other conference in the country. Have a good relationship with your professors. Go to office hours, send emails when necessary. I regret not having a better relationship with faculty. Lastly, live in the moment. College will challenge you and will be tough but you will also have some of the most enjoyable experiences during your time at auburn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/blyzve/advice_to_incoming_freshman_from_a_recent_graduate/,Aldebarannnn,51,2019-05-07 21:11:43,5,/r/auburn/comments/blyzve/advice_to_incoming_freshman_from_a_recent_graduate/

bpi3a3,My roommate died yesterday morning.,"My roommate was a 64 year old man.  He had heart problems and he was a diabetic going to dialysis three times a week.  Tuesday morning, I woke up to him banging on my door a 6:30am asking me to take him to the ER.  He was complaining of severe chest and stomach cramps.  I took him to EAMC and they put him on an EKG and did a chest x-ray.  Those came out fine and they just sent him home telling him to go to dialysis.  He then went to dialysis.   He got home around 5:30pm and at 6pm went to his room.  He never came back out.   Next morning around 11am, I start to worry.  I knock on his door and he doesn't answer.  I call landlord and she comes over and to unlock his bedroom door.  She ends up having to remove the doorknob because it's a keyless lock.  We go in and he's lying face down on the floor next to his bed.  

He's got no family whatsoever.   Me and my mother where basically his only friends.  He knew something was wrong Tuesday morning and EAMC didn't take it seriously and just sent him home.  I am really upset about this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/bpi3a3/my_roommate_died_yesterday_morning/,JaevlaSkit,108,2019-05-16 17:00:56,23,/r/auburn/comments/bpi3a3/my_roommate_died_yesterday_morning/

bpnetv,EAMC Could not be a worse hospital (at least in the ER department),"A vent post. After seeing the post about improper treatment at EAMC of a roommate leading to his death, I decided to talk about my recent experience with the hospital. A few weeks ago I had a kidney stone so I went to the hospital for tremendous pain (not my first rodeo in the E.R. with a kidney stone, except this time I was in Auburn and not back home). Absolutely ridiculous. A large college town and not only is the nearest hospital in another city miles away, but you may as well tough it out instead of going there for an emergency because they are fucking idiots who will tell you to do so anyway. Back home they handled my visit with a stone completely differently, they admitted me to the hospital immediately and administered strong pain meds, checked up regularly, knew what was going on and what pain meds I was on at all times, and kept me for a day before they removed it. A+ service. At EAMC, they kept me in a loud ass bright ass E.R. room with another patient, and I, while on very strong pain meds had to communicate every 2 seconds to the next person who came in about what meds they put me on and whatnot because there was zero communication, and I practically had to beg for those meds in the first place. I waited in the E.R. room originally for a very long time before I was given anything. They then sent me home with some weak pain meds that didn't do shit so I had to drive back in excruciating pain and wait and beg for more meds and, whilst on these meds, had to argue with the asshat doctor that I was in constant excruciating pain and would probably come back if they just sent me home again with nothing to help. So she prescribed me some strong meds finally. They did not put me in a room in the hospital, they had the worst levels of communication I've ever seen in a hospital, they did not listen to me whatsoever, they had no idea how to treat me (even I, as someone with no medical experience, knew that those meds they gave me dehydrated me and yet I was never given an I.V. to counteract my increasing dehydration as they did in my hospital back home), I couldn't have had worse treatment. A truly terrible place and I hope Opelika does something to make EAMC have standards instead of whatever backwoods dumbass medieval shit they're currently doing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/bpnetv/eamc_could_not_be_a_worse_hospital_at_least_in/,Ludrew,10,2019-05-17 01:47:57,24,/r/auburn/comments/bpnetv/eamc_could_not_be_a_worse_hospital_at_least_in/

brwc35,Rude Engineering Students,"At work today, I had the most awkward interaction with a customer.  A couple of meche students were picking up an order. My boss asked me to take it to the car for them. I loaded up the hand truck and brought it to the door. I walked up to them and said ""hey, how are y'all"", too which they replied ""good"". Not the common courteous response ""good, how are you"". Just... good. So we get to the door because I'm ready to take it out to the car. I pause for a good ten seconds because I assumed one of them would help with opening the door. Wrong! So I fumble with the door trying to get everything through without causing too much ruckus. I guess I should have asked for help but it seemed obvious that one of them should at least help with the door. We're walking out to their car and, being curious, I ask a question about the order. The question I asked involved the weather in may. He answered ""may"". This wasn't the answer to the question so I  was confused. He said ""may"" again. Still confused I asked what he meant. He said ""it's may"". I finally realized that he was correcting me for saying the wrong month. He didn't say ""I think you meant to say may"". He just kept saying ""may"". He never answered my question. Why would any one feel the need to correct someone on something so inconsequential that  they are obviously aware of. We are in the middle of fucking may. I know what month it is!

I'm not sure why they were being assholes. Maybe they lack social skills. Maybe they have some kind of superiority complex. 

Surprisingly, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. For some reason, it's always the engineering students. Most of them are great but a few bad apples ruin the bunch. 

All this being said, I am also an engineering student and I would never treat anyone like this. You should treat everyone with the same level of respect regardless of their title or perceived intellegence.

 If they weren't trying to be assholes and just don't understand how social interaction works then they definitely need to work on their Interpersonal skills. Interpersonal skills are almost as important as your actual degree to employers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/brwc35/rude_engineering_students/,jnp01,0,2019-05-22 20:14:13,3,/r/auburn/comments/brwc35/rude_engineering_students/

I currently have a review up on their facebook page ([https://imgur.com/a/t0XAD6a](https://imgur.com/a/t0XAD6a)) ([OAH reviews](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Opelika-Animal-Hospital-144741328901475/reviews/?referrer=page_recommendations_see_all&amp;ref=page_internal))  but I'm sharing my story here in case anyone wants to check out my thread to see the DOZENS of other people who have had their pets die there after being boarded. I've also had a few former employees respond and send private messages, including one person who quit after one day because they wouldn't sanitize the exam table after seeing a sick dog. I personally know that they've thrown away dead frozen dogs in the neighbor's trash can when they're too cheap to dispose of them properly and they don't want to get caught with dead dogs in their own dumpster.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I should have known better, but we boarded our beagles there over thanksgiving. Tripod was happy and normal when we dropped him off, but when we picked him up 3 days later he couldn't walk, eat or drink, and died after 36 hours of being picked up following constant diarrhea that turned into pure blood. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know exactly what happened to Tripod, but after speaking to 3 of the 4 vets at that practice we still haven't had one of them acknowledge that his bloody diarrhea and rapid death \*might\* have been due to an infection or that it could have been more than a coincidence. The two vets that own the practice wanted to place blame on us and say  our dog died of natural causes but never tested him for anything. Dr. Colley is a good family friend and wanted to act like he really cared when I made a special trip just to tell him how extremely pissed we are about our dog dying, but after I left he only ended up giving me a $100 discount for my dog's life and refused to acknowledge the possibility that they could be involved at all. We contested the rest of the bill but went ahead and paid him off when he threatened to sue us over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know dogs die at the vet and bills have to be paid, but I'd like to share the heinous assholery of this particular practice and warn anyone against doing business with them. Take your animals anywhere else because you really can't pick a worse vet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/bzm9ec/opelika_animal_hospital_is_by_far_the_worst_vet/,_iam_not_martha,48,2019-06-11 23:42:08,32,/r/auburn/comments/bzm9ec/opelika_animal_hospital_is_by_far_the_worst_vet/
bzn5l4,Stolen Royal Blue 2008 Toyota Corolla,"Last night, my bag was stolen from my car, which contained spare keys for said car (I know, big screw up). However, they hadnt realized the keys were in there and didn't take the car. I filed the police report, etc. 

About an hour or so after I get home from work today and park, I hear the car screeching down the parking lot, as someone reversed out quickly and floored it. My apartment is on North Donahue. Neither my girlfriend nor I were fast enough to gather any info about who took it (but they weren't smart enough to disengage the parking break).

I filed the necessary police reports and insurance claims. 

If anyone sees it, please let the police know when and where you saw it.

The blue on the car is rather unique and not a lot of cars have this color. Here's what the car looks like (not an image of my car exactly, but same make color and model): http://images.gtcarlot.com/pictures/17311805.jpg

I've been looking around on Zillow and other various rental sites and it's hard sifting through all the listings geared towards students. Is that still my best option or should I be looking elsewhere? I realize it's probably a tough time with school about to start.

I'm looking to transfer in Fall of 2020. You can apply between August 15th, 2019 and June 1st, 2020 for that fall semester as a transfer student. Long story short, it's gonna be tight for me to meet all of the requirements, but after taking a last few classes in Spring of 2020 I will meet everything. My admissions adviser told me that if I'm going to take any classes that I want to be factored into my admissions decision, I should wait to apply until I can get them a transcript that shows them as in progress.

So my question is, will it hurt me if I have to apply in December/January instead of August? I'm a little worried with my situation (After next Spring I'll have a ~2.8 GPA and **13** W's - yeah I know).

I could technically go ahead and apply this August with a 2.59 GPA, I was just wondering if anyone had any insight that could help me out.

cjhy0f,Launching a new finance app for college students,"Hey! We are Jordan and Jackie, co-founders of Thrive Savings. Our savings app for college students and new grads will launch in the fall.

We both struggled as students and left college with loans and credit card debt. It made the years after graduation a game of ‘catch-up’. It affected where we could live after grad (the ‘burbs was cheaper than the city) and meant we had to be super strict with our budgeting post grad (..ramen and lentils, anyone?). The point is, if we can help anyone start saving and thinking about this stuff a little earlier, we can save you stress and struggle. And you can learn from our pain.

To kick-off our waitlist (we are heading towards 100K strong), when you leave your email, you’ll be entered into the America’s Luckiest Student contest to WIN $25K (guaranteed prize) towards your student loans or tuition.

cpfeyi,Goo Goo Express Wash in Opelika has hit a new low.,"Review from Google Maps:   
I went for a Polymer Pro Full Service (basically a detail) on the 10th of July, 2019. After 3 seperate times of asking for my car to be cleaned properly thanks to finding dirt all over my rear bumber, rear windshield was still dirty, bugs all over my windshield, I got tired of asking the car to be cleaned and got the manager involved. After the bumber was finally cleaned, and bugs taken care of, I was given a voucher for a free Polymer Pro Full Service.  

I took advantage of that voucher on the 12th of August, 2019. Once again,  the trunk looked like it had not even been touched, let alone was not cleaned. After asking them to clean it again, one of the employees starts yelling at me ""What'd you say!?"" because I asked another employee ""The backseat is not cleaned. I can still see dirt all over it from the dogs trip to chewacla yesterday. Can we please get that cleaned?"" After going back inside, the young (black) man who was yelling at me asked me to come outside and started accusing me of being racist and sexist because ""That's a female you asked to clean your car.

crht4e,Practicality of Senior Design Project for CS Majors?,"I'm debating whether or not I should take the Senior Design Project course (COMP 4710) before I graduate. Since I'm not in SWEN, it isn't required but I'm thinking at the very least it would give me robust project that I could put on my resume.

I'm hesitant to take the course because I've had pretty bad experiences in most of my CS group projects so far (in terms of lack of effort or quality by other group members).  I'm looking through the  syllabus and none of the project descriptions look particularly interesting. The documentation and presentations in addition to the coding required seems like this course will be a huge time commitment as well.

I'm wondering whether it would still be worth it to take despite these concerns. My alternative would be to add an easy elective instead and use that same time to work on a personal project that I'm actually interested in and/or to interview prep with things like leetcode/CTCI/etc.

cts0ir,Looking for Musicians,"Hey yall,

I'm singer/guitarist looking for musicians to play a gig and potential future gigs with me this upcoming year.  I've been offered a gig at a tailgate at Georgia Southern in a couple weeks and I need some back in musicians to fill out the band.  I really need a drummer and bassist, but I'm down to jam with some other instruments too!  I normally play classic rock and some country, your basic standard tailgate/bar music.  So, if you want to play this gig and play some future gigs in Auburn and other college towns hmu!",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/cts0ir/looking_for_musicians/,Skeeter_Lee,3,2019-08-21 23:51:42,0,/r/auburn/comments/cts0ir/looking_for_musicians/
cts94b,$40 ticket for turning around on Thach Ave,"Like the title says, I received a $40 ticket from Transportation Services for **turning around** on Thach Ave to drop someone off for class, at which time I was evidently ""caught"" by AU's new amazing parking cams.  I spoke to the manager of Transportation Services and she stood by this, saying that ""driving on central campus is prohibited"" and I ""should have obeyed the signs.""

&amp;#x200B;

Is this not messed up to anyone else?  I mean, the signs are NOT obvious, and what are you supposed to do when you've already started turning left at the intersection and you *fortunately* *notice* the sign?  Throw it in reverse right there?

&amp;#x200B;

This is bugging the hell out of me.  I don't just have $40 lying around, and even though I appealed the ticket, if that's the attitude the manager had then I worry that I'm not going to get it appealed through the normal channels.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody speaks to me and barely speak back when being polite. I’ve been asked a few times already on campus also do I actually go to school here. It’s not that it bothers me so much as it’s just starting to get boring not having anyone to associate with and never being included.

My advisor told me that if I drop on the 31st, I’ll have taken over half of the class that I’m dropping and I won’t be kicked out of the class that requires it. So since I know I’m dropping the class, do I need to go to that class at all anymore? There’s a test before the 31st, would I just not show up and get a 0 on it?

dlipyf,Come support the Women's Soccer team this Thursday at 6:30pm!,"Hi guys. 

It's been about 6 months since I last posted here about my mom, Susan Kiechel. She's the founder of our women's soccer team, and last winter/spring you all helped us raise money to get her a life-saving treatment called a stem cell transplant. 

[Article explaining her story](https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/11/an-auburn-family-calls-for-help)

She completed SCT in May, and has been mostly quarantined since then because it takes time for the immune system to rebuild itself. She has been doing amazing, and hasn't had to be inpatient at the hospital since SCT. (Which is truly a miracle because she used to spend 7-10days in the hospital every month)

She just got approval to travel out of the state, so to celebrate we are coming to Auburn this week to catch one of the last women's soccer games. 

Its been a bit of a rough season for our soccer team, so I'm worried the place will be empty. If any of you have some free time, it would be so cool for mom to see the stands full of people supporting the team.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/dlipyf/come_support_the_womens_soccer_team_this_thursday/,SloanTheSloth,40,2019-10-22 10:29:58,6,/r/auburn/comments/dlipyf/come_support_the_womens_soccer_team_this_thursday/

I’m part of the tuba section, and we do this cool thing every year where when we find another tuba in our section, we take a picture of him/her and we post it in a GroupMe as a sort of game. 

What I’d like to know is what would happen if we expanded to as many of Auburn’s students as we could. I was thinking on how it’d work, and what I came up with was a twitter account that everyone could send tuba sightings to. I know this’d probably get boring after a while, so I could come up with an incentive if it gets enough traction. Maybe like a cash something, or a shirt... idk if it doesn’t stick, then it’ll be a fun little game for a little bit.

dpjasc,"Anybody's Electric Bill extremely high, especially at Samford Square?","They were doing some online automatic split thing last year. This year, they changed it, and a lot of people weren't happy September. There were enough people pissed off that they printed out little handouts with the phone number to call to get information. Turns out, the contracting company or whatever it is is combining everybody's money owed in the entire community, and splitting it between everybody! My bill was $188, in a 4 bedroom apartment by myself. The fan stays on in my bedroom, and the A/C is set automatically. I don't use my living room, computer stays on and gaming system usually on while I'm at home.   


I'm sorry, but that's pretty damn high. That's what the bill was when there were 3 of us, but there is less power being used.   
When I lived at The Social the 2 years before last (that was regretable for a number of other reasons), the power/water bill when I was able to pay Alabama Power across the street in person, the bill was usually around 120, and it was under 100 during the winter.   


So, what the hell gives?! I never signed anything about this new system of payment. I already tried talking to the office, and they basically brushed me off. I'm not about to pay this bill, AGAIN! It's another $188 for the month of September, and I'm in an apartment all by my damned self! This is rediculous!

Auburn has to worry about Alabama’s receivers in 1-on-1 coverage, and Alabama has to worry about Gus Malzahn’s schemes leading to more blown assignments against the run.

I think the winner will score 28 points or less, and I’ll take under 50 for the game.

e47zxt,Unpopular opinion: Winning the iron bowl this year is the worst thing to happen to Auburn.," With that win, Gus isnt going anywhere and I cant stomach it anymore. I dont care if I went there, I will keep watching Auburn Basketball, Auburn baseball and all of the other sports but I am done watching auburn football as long as gus is there. Most of the fans are okay with being a mediocre program.  The victory may feel good tonight but think about the long term future of the football program. Next year, that entire defensive line will be gone as well as the entire offensive line since all of them are seniors. If Gus Malzahn cant win or just compete for a championship with this group, What makes you think he can do it without that D and O line? Look at other power 5 coaches out there, Ryan Day at Ohio State has an offensive machine with Justin Fields. Who the hell is Ryan Day? LSU has a machine on offense with Joe Burrow and Ed Orgeron is their head coach. Lincoln Riley recruits transfer quarterbacks who put up big numbers every year. Gus has been there longer than any of these coaches and has not had a scoring machine since 2014. I see no reason why it will be better next year and this win over a weakened Alabama team who we knew struggled on defense against LSU and hadnt played anybody will keep him in Auburn for the foreseeable future.   

The data doesnt lie:

1. What software is typically used (I've heard Adobe Illustrator which doesn't seem too demanding. Anything else?) and what specs would you recommend? I'm mainly unsure about whether dedicated graphics are needed or whether a modern iGPU or APU would be sufficient.

2. The website says there are labs in Wallace but I don't know if he'll always have access to them either during or outside of class. Would having a capable desktop at home and a minimal laptop in addition to the labs be fine? Or would you recommend having a laptop that can run everything you need? (such as if you're in class that isn't in or can't use the computer labs?)

I've already got most of the desktop parts lying around so going that route plus a minimal laptop would be cheaper I think. However, I just want to make sure it wouldn't cause problems for him later on.

What is the best place to get them from?
Is it worth shopping around for the best deal, or are they prices pretty standard?
Is it better to wait closer to the game or buy them in advance for the best price?

Just a heads up to anyone considering moving to the area from someone that has been here for a long time. If you need emergency assistance, you should be very concerned about getting care.

f3p9mf,I'm an Auburn CS grad working in big tech. Ask me anything!,"Hey everybody!

I graduated from Auburn a few years ago with degrees in Computer Science and Music Performance. While I was in school, I worked with Dr. Narayanan as an Undergraduate Engineering Fellow, under Drs. Biaz and Chapman in the UAV lab, and with Dr. Hendrix as a UTA for COMP 2210.

I've been a software engineer at Amazon since graduating, am now a mid-level engineer, helped an unfunded start-up bootstrap a product, and am back on the interview grind again (which I started off by successfully completing a surprisingly rigorous interview loop at Apple).

I feel like Auburn's CS program and faculty prepared me well for a successful career in software development, but there were plenty of things I had to teach myself, learn the hard way, and seek out resources for on my own along the way as well. My hope is that I can answer a few questions to help any of you CSSE folks get one step closer to where you want to end up, and leave behind some searchable content for those who come later on and hope to find answers to their questions here.

While r/cscareerquestions can be a good resource for tech career information, my thought is that my Auburn-specific experience might be useful to this particular audience.

I ran this by the mods, and while I'm not uploading proof with this post I'm happy to provide it to the mods if there's a call for it.

f4k5th,How To Get More Involved In Auburn,"A little background first or you can skip along to the next paragraph but this context I think helps.  For my freshman-junior years a family issue made me care nothing but going to class and going back to my hometown.  Now that the family issue has resolved, I'm a senior graduating in December but I have no friends other than my 2 roommates.  This is a problem since I'm painfully shy but, I don't like being alone having nothing but school to do.

I've been looking around for clubs that I  can get involved in but do not know which ones to look into.  I like playing sports, playing Xbox, watching anime, and drawing (I'm not good but I enjoy it).  I've thought of going to one of the churches but they seem intimidating because once again I know zero people.

I guess what I'm asking is what clubs or organizations could I fit into or more importantly will there be any organizations or clubs that will want a senior who is joining mid semester.  Any suggestions or anyone that would like to hangout that are in a similar situation would be helpful!  I'm optimistic I can find someone I click with but I just do not know how to do it!

I see a lot of posts here asking about how to get involved, where to make friends, or what to do here at Auburn.

In order to start a club at Auburn, we need at least 10 people interested in joining or committed to joining. Please fill out our Google Form if youre interested so I can get the club registered and start advertising! Suggestions are welcome too. Thanks!!

f50z2y,Dedicated Discord Community For College And University Students/Alumni Worldwide (Over 1000 Members),"Hello Auburn University,

Recently, a Discord community by the name of “Welcome to College” was created for college and university students. It is now over 1,000 people in size, made up of students and alumni from around the world. The server is based out of North America and we are looking to expand our community further. Unlike other Discord communities, which tend to be meetup or hangout chats with little purpose or direction, our server is focused on being oriented for college and university topics, while also offering space for the exploration of a variety of other subjects.

We have channels catering to a variety of interests, including sports, music, politics, technology, cars, anime, gaming, and lots more! We also have a college advice channel for people looking to learn more about university schooling, a class scheduling channel to both show-off and get feedback on your schedule, and tutoring/homework help channels with Tutors you can reach out to, along with various other college-related channels and resources.

To top everything off, we also have both a Semi-Vanilla and Modded Minecraft server along with a Steam group. Various community events occur weekly and our custom Discord bot is continuously being updated with new features.

If you need people to play games, vent, chat, or study with, consider hopping in and introducing yourself! Whether you’re a high school/secondary school student or have already graduated from your university, everyone is welcome here at Welcome To College!

TL:DR- We've made a college and university orientated Discord server.

(I am from Opelika/Auburn and have a local drop off location),"Hosting a Shoe Drive with “Shoes with Heart” to help 2 great causes!

Hello Traveler! 

We are here seeking your help and assistance gathering quantities of gently used and new shoes that help support two wonderful causes on a local and global scale! 

We are fundraising by way of a shoe drive and are looking to gather a total of 7800 pairs of shoes which will be donated to Shoes with Heart. Shoes with Heart is a Funds2Orgs Brand dedicated to supporting Micro-Enterprises around the world.

But what is a Micro-Enterprise, you ask...

In third world countries around the globe systemic poverty runs rampant, making work and educational opportunities nearly impossible to grasp. With the help of Shoes with Heart it’s now possible for poverty stricken families and individuals to own and operate their own businesses. Shoes with Heart provides the necessary inventory needed to sell product, run a business, and earn money to support themselves and their families. This will lead them out of poverty giving them a brighter future with many more opportunities to survive and prosper. 

I am trying to gather a goal of 7800 pairs of shoes that will be broken down into 300 bags with 25 pairs of gently worn/new shoes of any size or gender.

By donating your shoes, you are not only supporting Micro-Entrepreneurship on a global scale, but any proceeds made from this shoes drive will be directly donated to “Service Dogs of Alabama” to help raise and train a psychiatric service dog for those in need diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Those looking to apply for a service dog must raise half the cost of the total amount is cost to raise, board, fees, and most importantly, trained which can be upwards of $30,000! By collecting 7800 pairs of shoes, $3,000 dollars will be donated to Service Dogs of Alabama to help those who need help fundraising for the cost of a dog. 

If you are interested in helping with my shoes drive, please PM me and I will provide you with a shipping address to the warehouse where the shoes will be stored until 7800 are gathered.

The US Post Office offers a Fixed Rate 3 day shipping up to 70lbs for 20$ which is about 35 pairs of shoes, depending on the weight (shoes weight about 1-2 lbs per pair). 

If you gather 70lbs of shoes and need assistance with shipping costs PM me and we’ll see if we can assist you.

And you can make your own hours so this would work great for students and people who may be looking for part time work.

I wake up and walk straight to my computer in a hurry.
I browse around the website.
I click on the link, the 250-bitrate live lecture begins.
As the students start to gather at rapid speed, as usual, or per tradition as we like to call it -- one of the students sends a message to everyone in the stream, followed by an ear-piercing notification. 
Not so long after, as the chat section is bloomed with welcome and greet emoticons, the clock hits 00 and the lecture begins.
I ready myself and position my hand on my keyboard.
We can see the professor checking the chat zoom by, and we are immediately put under slow-mode.
The long awaited lecture begins as the professor lets out a light sigh:

1.) What are your recommendations for living arrangements? I will have a car but would like to live at a place where tiger transit runs because parking can be difficult. So does anyone have places they recommend looking into thats relatively cheap? like $500-550 max rent. Totally looking for roommates as well as I don’t think i can live alone on the money I’m making from my TA.

fv4i9q,In case you aren't taking COV 19 seriously,"Spoke to my mother in Opelika this morning. My brother and I grew up in Auburn and went to Auburn but both live out of state. Mom has followed our orders to not leave her house for a month except once for groceries.

She was really upset because evidently some Auburn students hung around their apartment basically chilling and partying after classes were cancelled. For a while. They were asked to leave but didn't. 

Later one finally went home and his father got sick immediately and passed away within several days for COV19. The doctors tested every one and it was the son who stayed in Auburn. Now the son lives with this the rest of his life. 

I don't know anything else, except my mother  was really upset and said that's what her friends in town told her.

Yesterday on this thread I was downvoted for telling the truth about ER in NYC turning away cardiac arrest victims.

g03ydt,Graduate Student Org and Housing,"Hi,

I'm an incoming graduate student  at Auburn, I was wondering if there is a facebook page for grad students. I'm also hoping there is some suggestions on good places to live that are affordable with the standard TA stipend (\~$25,000). Also, any advice and thoughts on how far the stipend goes would be appreciated.

g1hpcb,Is parking a problem at Auburn?,"Hello guys! Since the last year, I’ve been working on a project to address the parking problem at universities. I’ve developed a business model with a solution to the problems I identified at FAU, the university I went for my bachelors. Later, I realized from talking to students from other Universities, that the problems are present in most of the largest Universities in the USA.

&gt;Every semester students face the same problem; having to arrive at school 30 minutes to one hour earlier just to be able to have time to find a parking spot. It is a real hassle being able to find a parking spot and it becomes frustrating and stressful. 

A group of friends and I decided to continue with the idea and commit to solving the problem. So, to help us better build a solution for the students and the schools, we are asking students at various Universities a few questions about their experience when parking at your university campus. We would appreciate your help with this! We are on the way to developing something GREAT for the infrastructure, not only for one university but for all other universities in the United States.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.

It is a Google Forms format, and it will only take you 1 minute!

g1v224,auburn and religion,"# 

Our daughter is finalizing her school of choice and among the leaders is Auburn. We are a conservative, Republican family. Our daughter's ethnic background is Jewish, but as a family we are not religious and being jewish is just barely a part of her life. Throughout her life, our daughter has made strong friendships with friends of all religions and is very tolerant.

In searching for roommates, my daughter noticed many students write about their love of Christ or looking for someone to go to church with. She loves Auburn and the fact that the student body is fairly religious is not an impediment for her. We are concerned that her background may be viewed as an impediment for others.

As a result, I am looking for an honest answer to the question:

 and Norway too! Check out the list, it also contains enrollment statistics by States of the US.

gelnop,Leasing 2br/1.5ba Apartment Next to Downtown -- $650/mo,"Hey everyone,

I may be posting this prematurely, but I wanted to start talking to anyone interested in taking over my lease. As the title suggests, the apartment is 2 bedrooms/1.5 bathrooms (2 stories) and located near downtown (specifically, right across from Acre). It's about a 5 minute walk to Toomer's and I was able to comfortably walk to classes everyday. 

Water is included, but electric is not (generally runs us about $120/mo during the summer/winter). 

We're both on the job hunt and are planning to leave Auburn sometime during the summer, so the apartment would likely be available at the start of August or sometime in July. There's a possibility that it would be available in June, but it's all dependent on our job situations. 

It's not a shiny new apartment by any means (a lot of the appliances are dated and some of the carpet is a little old), but I've always considered this one of the best hidden gems in terms of price/location. It's more of a townhouse in feel and has its own front porch, back porch, and upstairs balcony. 

Send me a DM if you're interested and I can provide pics and give you any other information you need.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/gelnop/leasing_2br15ba_apartment_next_to_downtown_650mo/,jdn0023,1,2020-05-06 11:02:29,1,/r/auburn/comments/gelnop/leasing_2br15ba_apartment_next_to_downtown_650mo/

gnmqac,looking to hire an assistant video editor,"Hi all, I'm looking for a local video editor to help with my growing YouTube channel. 

I'm willing to pay, but it wouldn't be much at this stage until I get more revenue coming in. Probably only $50-$100 per video, depending on length and **quality of your work**. Videos I'd have you work on would probably be 30 min or less, while I tackle the bigger projects that can run 1-2 hours.

It's a Star Wars themed channel, doing video essays and vfx comedy edits. Having a working knowledge of SW films/lore is a **must,** as you will need to know how to quickly find each section of the film I'm discussing to pull clips from.  

I'm still a super small channel but I already have a couple Patrons, and many people said they're confident the channel will blow up eventually, so this job could definitely turn into a bigger opportunity for you down the road.

I'm fine with a student editor as long as they have a portfolio showing a strong grasp of the basics.

I'd want you editing using Adobe CC and Premiere Pro, ideally on a windows 10 PC, so we can easily exchange project files without worrying about compatibility. 

Ideally I'd love to have someone who knows After Effects, so I can have help with the comedy edits as well, but I know that's more rare of a skill set.

Feel free to reach out if anyone interested has questions or would like to meet.

gnzoev,Concerning the Privacy of Online Proctoring,"So yesterday classes began. Given the circumstances, all classes are online this summer. Most of my classes are using some form of proctoring service to prevent or deter cheating and it honestly has made me really concerned about privacy. I’ll start with ProctorU. This service forces you to take an exam while a live person is in an undisclosed location watching you and using various methods to determine whether or not you’re cheating. I find it very concerning though because before you start a test you must give them access to your computer and rather than them manually close and disable processes, they run a script that does all of this, plus it could be stealing anything from your file system or retaining your information on a random server that we, the students, will never have access to. I have used this service before. The second service is HonorLock. I personally have no experience with this service, but from what I have read it actually uses AI to record and monitor what you do which can then be flagged for human review. One thing that I find particularly damning about this service is their touted feature of being able to detect if you use your phone and in turn, SCREEN RECORD your phone to “prove you were cheating”. To me, it is one thing to watch someone take a test to better the chances of cheating detection, but it is completely different to collect and store data. Don’t even get me started on how honorlock can allegedly monitor other network devices. I also want to mention the fact that both companies sell data to third parties for profit. In America, do we not have the right to privacy? Does FERPA not explicitly say that universities must maintain the privacy of its students? I realize that some may say these services are a choice because one could choose not to take the class, but given the current situation, do we really have a choice? I realize that some people might take online classes in order to cheat, but why should everyone have to succumb to data mining when not everyone cheats. Cheating is evident in other ways. Good luck maintaining a job if you never actually learned the material. This is how cheating should be reprimanded. We give thousands of dollars to our colleges only to have them solicit other companies to do the proctoring for them. Auburn could simply implement something similar to what we had in high school computer labs. So many people could still be employed if they were able to proctor the tests internally at Auburn or even from their homes. There is no reason to allow third parties access to our education. I’m eager to know everyone’s opinions on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/gnzoev/concerning_the_privacy_of_online_proctoring/,glowgan99,10,2020-05-21 12:09:22,42,/r/auburn/comments/gnzoev/concerning_the_privacy_of_online_proctoring/

h0tufj,Cat in Need of Adoption!,"Hey, guys. I hope everyone is staying safe, and much love to all of you.   
My boss back in March mentioned to me that he was moving and might leave his cat. Flash forward to earlier this month, I inquire about it, and he still had not found her a home and was planning to leave her for the new neighbors. I intervened, and decided that I would take her in for a short time to give her love and attention until I can find her a home.  
She is FIV and leukemia negative and next week she will be up to date with all of her shots and boosters. She is twelve years old and has some sort of trauma-related spinal injury - but she is fine, aside from a hobble.   
She is SO sweet. Like, so sweet. She loves attention. She loves being around people. The only negative experience I have ever had with her is if you pet her too much, she might swat at you.   
She was an outside cat and I am transitioning her to being primarily an inside cat. With that being said, she does not interact well with other cats. I have been working for a week or two to integrate her with my own little dude (thanks, Jackson Galaxy), and when I finally thought they might be ready to be in the same area she was very upset the whole time.   
Let me know if you have any questions and I will do my best to answer. If you cannot give her a home, please, please share around so she can find one. She really deserves a loving family and someone to give her all of the love to match the love she has to give.  
Thanks so much!   
Tldr; twelve year old sweetheart cat in need of a home, relatively healthy, loves people but not so much other animals.

hkw3h1,Is the Case of Former Auburn Coach Pat Dye Evidence That There Is a Hidden number of C19 Deaths?,"https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/auburn/2020/05/20/legendary-auburn-football-coach-pat-dye-hospitalized-after-testing-positive-covid-19-coronavirus/5234095002/

Pat Dye tested positive for Covid-19 after recieving a precautionary test several days before being hospitalized for a kidney problem on May 20th. Ten days later on June 1st Pat was dead. Cause of Death was recorded as Kidney and Liver failure.

Pat was considered to be asymptomatic for C19 but this surely should be raising questions.

It has been widely reported that C19 attacks the lungs with obvious pnuemonia like symptoms but less well reported that it can also attack other major organs including the liver, kidneys, heart and brain resulting in multiple organ failure. When it attacks the lungs the symptoms are obvious but what about when it is attacking other organs like the liver and kidneys instead? Is that being wrongly labeled as asymptomatic because covid-19 is so much associated with the respiratory condition? If Pat Dye's Covid-19 infection did not cause his liver and kidneys to all fail at the same time, then what did?",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/hkw3h1/is_the_case_of_former_auburn_coach_pat_dye/,KnowOneTwoEat,20,2020-07-03 22:51:37,20,/r/auburn/comments/hkw3h1/is_the_case_of_former_auburn_coach_pat_dye/

hl4uwx,Question for former or current Niffer’s employees,"Ever since quarantine started in March and restaurants started curbside service, I’ve discovered that I’m quite the fan of the DIY to-go fishbowls. But, they’re a bit pricey at $38.

So I’m wondering if anyone can tell me what all is in the fruity mix that’s combined with the Long Island Ice Tea mix. I feel like Sprite is likely, since there’s a bit carbonation going on. And I could be mistaken but it almost tastes like there’s a hint of salt? What else is used? I’d really like to save some $$$ and try to replicate it at home.

hnrdrt,"Give smart advices to an international graduate student. I mean, please.","[FEEL FREE TO RESPOND TO JUST ONE OR MORE TOPICS, THANK YOU!]

Hi, everyone, I am a recently admitted graduate student at Auburn University. I will start my activities in the Fall of 2020 and right now I am struggling with a few basic things that American or more experienced college students might find easy to solve or at the very least find smarter solutions in order to make things cheaper and easier. I am saying that because I will rely almost entirely on my assistantship and I cannot risk being in a bad financial situation. Here a few things I would like to know about:

1. HOUSING: I am still looking for cheap options, where I could live comfortably, without spending too much money with transportation. I am also looking for a place where I could have a private and quiet space to write my articles, reports and cook my food. Being close to a Walmart or similar would be also good so I could buy groceries without too much displacement. (All the options listed by AU to international students seemed to be very expensive, fancy and impossible due to my very short budget). How much do you consider a rent cheap or expensive ? How can I find good options outside these mainstream companies offering apartments? What are the main things I should look for and how do I avoid these very fancy/expensive places without losing quality?  I am okay with sharing a place with one more person, but it would be nice if I could find a small and private place. 

2. MEALS: I had an experience in the US as an undergrad, and during that time the government paid for a meal plan in the University that covered all the main meals and made it very easy for me. Right now the situation is different, I am going by myself, with my assistantship to cover my expenses. Due to that, I would like to know if the meal plan is a financially sustainable option, and, if not, what are good ways to eat well without expending lots of money. I am okay if I have to cook and take my meals with me, although it's always better if I can save the time.

3. WORKOUT: I go to the gym regularly (except for these troubled times of quarantine). I am interested in a place where I can workout regularly. I saw in the AU website the Recreation and Wellness center. As a full-time graduate student, would I be allowed to use the space ? Is it crowded there ? 

I believe these are my main concerns for now. Thank you all for your time and help.

hsv7pd,Please Read This!,"I’ve lived in Auburn/Opelika area all 21 years of my life. I love this place! It’s just an amazing community to be a part of. I am a senior this year at Auburn and I of course like a lot of you are thinking that our college life is going to look different. This year is not going to be easy for some of y’all,especially the freshman who this will be their first year here. I just want to encourage everyone and also give a word of caution to you guys. My encouragement is that we are so fortunate to be able to come back to campus. In a world where a lot of schools have gone online, we are so privileged to be here. Being back doesn’t mean that our world is going back to normal. Although I wish it wasn’t the case, we will still have to wear masks and social distance. I beg everyone reading this to abide by the rules and be smart. I know we love hang out with friends but be smart. We have to do our part! This is the only way to keep each other safe. You should think of other people instead of just yourself. I know that places downtown are big hangouts at night but I just want you to be smart. I’m not saying to not go and have fun I’m just pleading for you to have fun while obeying the rules. We have a job to do as a community, a city, and as a state to make sure that we keep each other safe. We can’t do it without each other or else we might not be here in the spring.

The maintenance team is pretty good too, and they usually get to my apartment on the same day of making a request. Being located close to campus is great, and taking Tiger Transit to campus to get to my classes has never been a hassle for me. I will say though that the apartments are a bit overpriced for what they are, but that's really the only negative thing I have to say.

hyppgd,Research that shows Auburn is in good shape rn,"tl;dr I'm working on a final paper for a summer class and found this article that has beefy data to show that Auburn will ~~survive~~  thrive through this pandemic/financial crisis.

The article describes how the researcher worked his analysis. The chart is the only place you'll see Auburn mentioned.

It is not a rosy picture for the whole town, but (on paper) the school will be ok:

""The US has 4% of the world's population and 25% of the infections and deaths. Phase 1 of the spread was enabled by a mix of arrogance and incompetence. It appears the virus did not get the memo about our exceptionalism and is indifferent to our optimism. The venues for spread were cruise ships and nursing homes. Phase 2 found governors infected with the same arrogance, enabling a younger generation of super-spreaders. Again the virus appeared rude and unwilling to read the room, and recognize our desire to return to normalcy. A Phase 3 wave appears to be forming, due to a mix of economic pressure and lack of imagination on the part of academic leadership.""

i9aebu,Missed connection: Ass nekkid man in Tuskegee forest,"I won't lie, I was prepared to answer some questions. I'm an amateur taxidermist (just a hobby) and left a rat out in a tub in the woods to macerate last week. This morning I went back out to retrieve it with my roommate, and I am more than aware that two women in the woods, one sitting on a bucket pickin rat bones out a strainer, is not average. 

So when we heard a car pull up, we were bracing ourselves for having to explain the process of what we were doing and reassure this person, whoever they were, that we were not in fact serial killers. When we heard you comin down the trail we got even more nervous.

I was in the brush while my roommate stood on the trail, so I didn't see anything other than a blur of flesh color when you saw us, made eye contact with my roommate and busted ass in the opposite direction. When my roommate looked at me and said, ""THAT MAN WAS NEKKID...!"" I am sorry that I laughed, if you heard it, I hope it didn't hurt your feelings.

In the car afterwards, my roommate said to me, ""I saw he didn't have a shirt on, then I looked down and saw his dick out... I thought damn, am I really gonna have to fight a nekkid man for my life?"" I thank you for running away from us instead of towards us, as I carry knives and mace with me everywhere, and that would have been unpleasant for everyone involved. I also thank you for not walking by as though nothing was wrong, because I genuinely have no idea how I would have reacted to a nonchalant nekkid man in the woods walking past. 

We just have so many questions. The tables turned in an instant-- instead of the ones prepared to answer questions, we were the ones with burning questions. Why were you nekkid in the woods on an established trail? Did you have time to put your clothes back on before you peeled out the trailhead parking? What kind of life do you lead that led you to this moment? Was this a one time thing, or do you do this often?

Regardless, you made our day. I called my mom and told her about it as soon as I got home. If you read this, I beg you: please wear clothes in the woods. Is getting Lyme's disease really worth the spiritual and/or sexual benefits of having your dick out in the woods?

iaa0lw,IDEA: How the Rec Center can still do Free Weights during the Fall Semester,"On the Rec Website it says that the Free Weights Area is closed. However, basketball courts 3 through 6 are also closed. They were smart with converting courts 1 - 2 as an open area for stretching. My idea is to use the remaining 4 basketball courts for an extremely socially distanced dumbbell area. 

Basically, you take all the moveable benches from the free weights area and distance them evenly on the court. Hypothetically, you could get upwards of 30ft between each area. Then, along the wall is all the dumbbells. I would put them against the wall and distance each pair by at least 10ft. People could easily distance themselves while grabbing and putting back weights. The weights would be placed on the carpet mat thing that they use for the bench areas during intramural basketball games. The opposite wall would have the wipes needed to clean each bench afterwards. 

With these courts currently closed, the Rec is missing out on a huge area that they can utilize for safe exercise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/iaa0lw/idea_how_the_rec_center_can_still_do_free_weights/,BraxxIsTheName,1,2020-08-15 12:08:23,5,/r/auburn/comments/iaa0lw/idea_how_the_rec_center_can_still_do_free_weights/

I just recently got orders (I'm Air Force) to Montgomery but I'm planning on living in Auburn and commuting.  I'm looking at 12 hour days from the time I leave my place to when I get back home from duty.  I have a dog who is very well trained and behaved but is kenneled during the day.  Obviously 12 hours is too long to kennel an animal so I'm looking for affordable options to help me care for her when I'm at work.  I looked at doggy daycare but its way out of my budget (unless someone knows of a more affordable/reputable place?), I'm looking at Rover but thats still $400+ a month for what I'm looking for.  I'm hoping to get a place with a yard and doggy door but I'm preparing for that not being a possibility.

ikdpki,Volunteers to lead English as a Second Language virtual classes,"Hey everyone, we're in the process of bringing the International &amp; American Student Alliance (IASA) to Auburn and one of its biggest programs is English Clusters. This program provides free, non-credit English as a Second Language (ESL) classes to international students who want to practice and improve their English skills in a casual environment. These classes are typically led by students who are native (or at least near fluent) English speakers and interested in helping international students and/or gaining teaching experience. 

Class topics can range anywhere from skill-based (i.e. pronunciation, writing for graduate students, reading) to topic-based (i.e. Southern culture, American movies) to casual conversation-based (i.e. discussion of current events, practicing English by playing games). While the teaching opportunities in this program are great for those studying to become English/ESL teachers or wanting to teach abroad, we still encourage you to reach out if it sounds interesting to you. 

For this semester, all of these classes will be completely virtual and will begin the week of Monday, September 14th. Classes typically meet once a week for around 50 minutes and there's a lot of flexibility for the day/time that they can be taught. In addition to these classes being open to all Auburn international students, we're combining the English Clusters across all of the universities that our organization is at (Ole Miss, Georgia Tech, Southern Miss, University of Georgia, etc.) this Fall since everyone is virtual anyway. This means that an international student from Auburn can participate in a class led by someone at Ole Miss, and vice-versa. 

If this program sounds interesting to you and you'd potentially be interested in leading one of these classes, please dm me and I can give you more information!",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/ikdpki/volunteers_to_lead_english_as_a_second_language/,at11b5,1,2020-09-01 00:25:09,0,/r/auburn/comments/ikdpki/volunteers_to_lead_english_as_a_second_language/

ils07n,Want to save a life? Want to give back? Consider donating bone marrow!,"Hi guys, I wanted to educate y'all about the need for bone marrow transplants and hopefully get some of you to consider joining the gift of life bone marrow registry involved with gift of life on my campus at UCF considering the fact that Auburn does not have anyone involved with Gift of Life to my recollection.

Mind you all of this is free and I don't make money from this!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Joining the bone marrow registry is very simple. You just have to go online, fill out a few questions and have a swab kit sent to you for free. The entire process is extremely simple. [You can order one here by clicking ""Get Swabbed""](https://www.giftoflife.org/dc/SaarPele)

&amp;#x200B;

\-Blood cancer is a general term for cancers of the blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic system

\-1 person every 3 minutes, 480 people a day, 175,200 people a year in the US are diagnosed with a type of blood cancer.

\-Leukemia (cancer in blood and marrow), Lymphoma (cancer of lymphatic system), and Myeloma (cancer of plasma cells) are the 3 main types of blood cancers

\-For many patients, a bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant may cure them, and this may come from family members or unrelated volunteers. About 30% of people in need have a matching family member, however that means that 70% of people need to look for unrelated volunteers to donate.

\-Don't worry about the myths of bone marrow transplants. About 80% of donors donate peripheral blood stem cells similar to a platelet donation. The other 20% donate bone marrow cells from the hip under sedation and is relatively painless with mild soreness at worst.

\-Recipients that are part of a minority group have the hardest time finding a donor on the registry. Only 25% of black or multi-racial patients will have a donor on the registry, 40% of Asian-American, and 45% of Hispanic/Latinx. Their best chance is finding someone with a similar ethnic background.

\-There is a 1 in 200 chance you will be called as a potential match and 1 in 5 potential matches will be asked to donate.

I've personally joined the bone marrow registry seeing how simple it might be to save someone's life in exchange for a quick procedure. If you're interested in starting a Gift of Life program at Auburn just dm me!",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/ils07n/want_to_save_a_life_want_to_give_back_consider/,thesaarguydude,1,2020-09-03 07:58:15,0,/r/auburn/comments/ils07n/want_to_save_a_life_want_to_give_back_consider/

iul0bh,A Simple Job Board Directory to help Students ( and Grads) find Remote Work sites 🏆,"As somebody who has been spending a lot of time trying to find remote work, I know how tough it can be these days.

I decided to build a simple directory of the Best Remote Job Boards broken into categories (General, Development, Writing, Marketing, Sales, Freelance etc...), Tools and subreddits to help make it easier for people find remote work who are just starting out. There's even a section for Remote Jobs and Internships for Students 🎓

iw9m56,The cop I was behind at a red light came up to my window cos I was crying lol,"2 am and I just spent like 2 hours crying in an empty parking lot because of some really serious issues in my life right now and as I was pulling out, I ended up behind this cop at a red light. I was visibly upset and I guess he saw because he got out of his car and came up to my window.

I was like holy shit this is not what I need right now. Cops make me super nervous because of some stuff about how I grew up and so I was freaking out thinking maybe he thought I was nervous about being behind him and he thought that I'd done something wrong.

However all he did was ask me what was wrong and I said it was personal family stuff because its really heavy shit and complicated af and I was nervous and didn't want to like vent all that shit at a random cop on the street. But he could tell I was fr upset I think cos he started giving me some like general life advice like just try to survive the day, and it made me tear up again. He told me to get myself home and let me go.

I feel bad because I was pretty stiff on account of being nervous and in hindsight I know that he was just trying to be nice. It actually means a LOT to me that he cared enough to check in with me when he saw I was upset. I drive a really distinctive car so I'm sort of nervous about him seeing me around and being like ""oh shit its that weird lady"" but if I ever do run in to him again I'd like to thank him properly for being so nice.

I just wanted to share on the off chance he sees this (do cops even use reddit lol) but mostly to get it out of my system so I can stop feeling guilty about not thanking him lmao

Thank you for caring, random cop!! If it happens again I can't guarantee that I won't spill my entire life story to you like some shitty tv drama, so watch out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/iw9m56/the_cop_i_was_behind_at_a_red_light_came_up_to_my/,bluetickblues,1,2020-09-20 03:50:37,14,/r/auburn/comments/iw9m56/the_cop_i_was_behind_at_a_red_light_came_up_to_my/

ixvg31,motorhome for sale - My First Auburn Home,"I always wanted to try and find ways to save money since I am an out of state student. One of my family members recommended I buy a large motorhome and live out of in in the nice campground University Station. This advise allowed me to save $12,000 in 2 years by living in a 35 foot Coachmen motorhome. During this time I restored and refurbished the home with wood floors, a 55 flat screen, new roof and exterior paint... the whole 9 yards (lots more). I was also able to travel to state parks and vacation spots over the weekend too! You can go anywhere you want and take everything with you, something most students wouldnt be able to do!

A bitter sweet moment coming to an end, I now must sell the amazing motorhome. I plan on staying in Auburn after graduation so I purchased a home a mobile home for the remainder of my time here :( . If youre looking for a place to stay, save some money, and maybe have an adventure while at it... I recommend taking a look!

iyykn4,"Cat (12 y/o, female, Bombay, up-to-date, fixed) in need of adoption!","Hi, again, everyone!  


Back in June, my boss was going to abandon his cat of twelve years after deciding to move. She is an older cat with some blunt force trauma to her back and a good deal of anxiety about other animals. I could not let her be left alone, nor could it settle on my heart that she could potentially be spending the rest of her days in a shelter competing with kittens. I took her in, and I have been taking care of her ever since.  
However, I do not have any intentions to be her forever-home. As unfortunate as it is, she and my rambunctious little dude (cat, 1 y/o) don't get along. Additionally, he has pica, and she (as a free-eating cat) is usually hungry because she has to eat on schedule. As a last note, I will be moving around a good bit within the next five years, and I do not want to add onto her already existing emotional toll.  
This cat is a wonderful little cat. She is extremely friendly and she loves attention. She will curl up on your lap and sleep, play, and give you the best company. She is healthy (aside from mild gingivitis per diagnosis of the vet, but nothing major to be treated), spayed, up-to-date on her vaccines, and deserves a good place for her to spend the rest of her days.   
If you cannot take her in and give her a home, I encourage everyone to ask around. It is so hard to find an older cat a home, especially in a college town where a lot of folks are looking to start their fur family. So please ask around, if you can, and let me know whenever.

Thank you all in advance! 

TLDR; if you want to give a sweet, older cat a forever home, message me! If you can't, please ask around! &lt;3

j401oy,"Professor not answering accommodations email, what can I do?","So I am struggling a ton with my health this semester(specifically with depression) so I received an accommodation from the office of accessibility to allow me to turn my assignments in late. I contacted all my professors about this on Wednesday, and heard back the same day from all but one. The one I have not head back from has several assignments due *this Sunday*, so it is very important that I have her approve(the professor must formalistically accept the accommodation before it is applied).  


I will say this teacher seems like the type that would be annoyed by an accommodation. For example, she says so late work will be accepted except in extreme cases. Perhaps because she is only a part-time instructor, and not a full professor, she does not understand how accommodations work here? She is obviously using her computer as she has updated grades on several assignments and emailed the class since Wednesday, she is just ignoring my email(and my follow up email I sent this morning, as I am desperate to receive some reply before the end of business today).

What should be my next step if the professor does not answer my email? Should I contact the dean of the college? Or who can I get involved in this so that I don't end up missing out on the accommodation(which I feel entitled too given my health! I am usually not an entitled person at all, but this is a situation where I have to assert myself to some degree).",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/j401oy/professor_not_answering_accommodations_email_what/,marcu90,1,2020-10-02 14:27:39,7,/r/auburn/comments/j401oy/professor_not_answering_accommodations_email_what/

j614tb,PSA: Mac n Cheese in the microwaves,"Hey there, so yesterday at approximately 3PM, the fire alarms went off inside of Tiger Hall. We evacuated the building, the fire trucks came (3 of em), and the alarm was shut off about 20 minutes later. According to AU FD, it was a flaming pile of plastic and charred noodles that set it off. To make matters worse, when the people in the hallway tried to mask the scent with febreeze, the alarms went off AGAIN not 15 minutes after the first alarm was shut off. AU FD came out AGAIN (bless their souls) and had to go in to find that the room in question smelled of burnt plastic, charred noodles, and a hint of lavender. This is the 2nd incident like this in the past two weeks in Tiger Hall.


So moral of the story: PLEASE know how to cook Mac N Cheese in the microwave WITH WATER before you make everyone evacuate the building. Seriously, the first time this happened (8 days ago) it went down at 10:45PM.

jjt3k5,REPOST: 12 y/o cat (f) in need of a home!,"Cat (12 y/o, female, Bombay, up-to-date, fixed) in need of adoption!

Hi, again, everyone!

Back in June, my boss was going to abandon his cat of twelve years after deciding to move. She is an older cat with some blunt force trauma to her back and a good deal of anxiety about other animals. I could not let her be left alone, nor could it settle on my heart that she could potentially be spending the rest of her days in a shelter competing with kittens. I took her in, and I have been taking care of her ever since.
However, I do not have any intentions to be her forever-home. As unfortunate as it is, she and my rambunctious little dude (cat, 1 y/o) don't get along. Additionally, he has pica, and she (as a free-eating cat) is usually hungry because she has to eat on schedule. As a last note, I will be moving around a good bit within the next five years, and I do not want to add onto her already existing emotional toll.
This cat is a wonderful little cat. She is extremely friendly and she loves attention. She will curl up on your lap and sleep, play, and give you the best company. She is healthy (aside from mild gingivitis per diagnosis of the vet, but nothing major to be treated), spayed, up-to-date on her vaccines, and deserves a good place for her to spend the rest of her days.
If you cannot take her in and give her a home, I encourage everyone to ask around. It is so hard to find an older cat a home, especially in a college town where a lot of folks are looking to start their fur family. So please ask around, if you can, and let me know whenever.

Thank you all in advance!

TLDR; if you want to give a sweet, older cat a forever home, message me! If you can't, please ask around! &lt;3",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/jjt3k5/repost_12_yo_cat_f_in_need_of_a_home/,humanoids_abby,1,2020-10-28 14:14:08,17,/r/auburn/comments/jjt3k5/repost_12_yo_cat_f_in_need_of_a_home/

**If** **you have not already had COVID-19, you are encouraged to consider getting tested for** **active** **COVID-19** **infection** **before holiday travel or spending time with family and friends.**

Small gatherings, such as holiday celebrations, [present ideal conditions](https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.com%2Fcondition%2Finfectious-diseases%2Fcoronavirus%2Fcdc-small-gatherings-covid&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cfred.kam%40eamc.org%7Cb1e7066d97634128f10e08d8874a6d8c%7C9d9a1cb29f644e01a5eab8addce71683%7C0%7C0%7C637408101895809876%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=eUc96ASU%2FqNQunOjB0j%2Fe1cRqUFRQQRNMufDvE9vaXI%3D&amp;reserved=0) for viral spread. Testing for COVID-19 can help you make informed decisions that can help protect the health of those around you, including loved ones who may be vulnerable to complications from the virus.

Below are options available to those who choose to take this important step:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Use an at-home testing kit.** A limited number of free testing      kits are available for enrolled students and employees. You should receive      results within 48 hours of      your sample arriving to the lab, but this is not guaranteed. The at-home      testing option is best for people with flexible travel plans or those who      are not required to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test when traveling.      Kits may be picked up from the Scholarship Room at Beard-Eaves-Memorial      Coliseum, 8 a.m. to noon and 1-4 p.m., Tuesday, Nov. 17 through Friday,      Nov. 20. Testing kits will be distributed on a first-come, first-serve      basis, until supplies run out.
2. **Get tested through the** [**AU Medical Clinic**](https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcws.auburn.edu%2Faumc%2Fpm%2FCOVID-19%23coronavirus&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cfred.kam%40eamc.org%7Cb1e7066d97634128f10e08d8874a6d8c%7C9d9a1cb29f644e01a5eab8addce71683%7C0%7C0%7C637408101895819869%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=3NcwEHAqn2P%2FMXx7R9iFZzwReQ5lwFvBiHzoplvGx%2BE%3D&amp;reserved=0) **or      another health care provider.** This option is best for those      planning to travel to [destinations](https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fpublichealthgateway%2Fhealthdirectories%2Fhealthdepartments.html&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cfred.kam%40eamc.org%7Cb1e7066d97634128f10e08d8874a6d8c%7C9d9a1cb29f644e01a5eab8addce71683%7C0%7C0%7C637408101895819869%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=njMMMRK9aZvRQy3eF%2F8wE3CFAsqqd1dfiDZEqw3YWU4%3D&amp;reserved=0) that      require proof of a negative COVID-19 test or a period of self-quarantine      upon entry, and it is a convenient option for everyone.

Before getting tested, be sure to ask about the      timeline for getting your results.
3. **Consider antibody testing.** If you believe you may have had      COVID-19 because you experienced symptoms and tested negative, you were      credibly exposed or think you may have had an asymptomatic infection, then      you may want to consider getting an antibody blood test. Antibody testing      is available through the [AU Medical Clinic](https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcws.auburn.edu%2Faumc%2Fpm%2FCOVID-19%23coronavirus&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cfred.kam%40eamc.org%7Cb1e7066d97634128f10e08d8874a6d8c%7C9d9a1cb29f644e01a5eab8addce71683%7C0%7C0%7C637408101895819869%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=3NcwEHAqn2P%2FMXx7R9iFZzwReQ5lwFvBiHzoplvGx%2BE%3D&amp;reserved=0),      the [AU Pharmaceutical Care Center](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/pharmacy/phs/clinic/employee.html) and      other health care providers.

k0bs22,End of semester and a look ahead message from President Gogue,"  

As we near the end of the semester, I take this opportunity to say thanks for making the best out of a difficult set of circumstances. 

We faced many unknowns and, through a lot work and understanding, we are close to completing a semester in a much better position than most would have imagined a few months ago. We learned a lot about ourselves, our colleagues and our students. It is clearly a mark of professionalism to face the unknown and remain flexible enough to navigate through perhaps the greatest time of change in this generation. 

During the next few weeks, we will review the COVID-19 situation carefully with health professionals and address our operational approach for spring semester. Many unknowns remain but be assured that our same guiding principles will be first and foremost in all decisions: the health and safety of the campus community, fulfilling the mission of the university and operating in conjunction with internal governance groups.

I appreciate all that you do to make Auburn a better place. In the break before finals, I hope you have time to refresh and renew and to carefully and safely reconnect with family and friends. 

Happy Thanksgiving!

 

Jay Gogue

I'm active duty Air Force and am getting stationed in Montgomery.  Because I want to pursue my Grad degree and live some place nicer, I'm planning on moving to Auburn and doing the commute 4 days a week.  I have an apartment setup and everything but now I'm hoping for advice on my next concern:

I currently have a service animal (Labrador/Pit mix) that helps me with PTSD.  Fortunately, I don't have to worry about landlords not leasing to me because of her breed due to having all of my medical paperwork to keep her.  But now I need to setup affordable dog care for her while I'm on duty.  She has a nice big kennel with plenty of toys and a bed but with my 12 hour days obviously I'll need to either put her in a doggie daycare or find a dog sitter or someone who can come let her out probably twice a day.  

Im hoping to not spend tons of money on this service so I'm hoping maybe to find someone locally that can help me care for her while I'm working.

kd9r7f,Thanks for the memories Gus.,"I was a first year junior college student at the time in Florida when the magical 2013 season happened. Come 2014  I was looking to transfer to a university where I feel like I'd be successful. I visited LSU since thats where my parents went to school, visited Florida state, visited Valdosta state and last but not least, I visited Auburn and the kick 6 had a big part in that decision. I instantly fell in love with the campus and the fact it wasn't in a huge city, not a rural area but not a huge city I would have to navigate. 

So I went to Auburn in fall of 2015 and I went to every home game through the 2017 season. We had some great moments like beating Alabama and Georgia back to back weeks and the emotional roller coaster of beating LSU in 2016 and the aftermath of some idiot setting the trees on fire. We also had some pretty terrible moments like most of the 2015 season and being blown out by Georgia and Alabama in 2018, almost losing to Jacksonville state and let's not forget when me and my girlfriend went to Atlanta and I got 50 yard line tickets only to watch us get our asses kicked by Georgia. 

All in all Gus ran a clean program and I never doubted that he's a great guy, just like when LSU fired les miles, it was just time. Thanks for the memories Gus. 

Also, I will be attending grad school at Auburm next fall, when the new coach will get started so hopefully we can make some new memories.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/kd9r7f/thanks_for_the_memories_gus/,DukeofWessexx,1,2020-12-14 18:47:16,4,/r/auburn/comments/kd9r7f/thanks_for_the_memories_gus/

khbnta,A Story for Those Who Hate Alabama (From a Former Fan),"So delete if you don’t allow this kind of thing here. I didn’t see it in the rules. I just wanted to post here because 1. I know if I post to an Alabama subreddit, I’ll be called all sorts of names. 2. I just want to rant about something that’s eaten me up for years.

Basically, my dad died 2 years ago and my mom and brother had to sell his house. Well, after inspection, they discovered it was on a very small amount of land owned by the University of Alabama. The amount was something extremely small like the corner of the house sat like 1 foot on their land. It wasn’t land they were using at all and was really far from campus. It was in Bibb County. 

So my mom reaches out and they basically say it has to be approved, but they think they’ll be able to gift her this small piece of land because she couldn’t easily afford to pay thousands to have the house moved. Months ago by and they suddenly stop calling or answering her calls, leaving her forced to pay the thousands to move the house, which was a huge hardship. 

A little background on who I am:

I’m a former Alabama fan and artist. I became a little bit popular among Alabama fans with my pencil drawings, even becoming known by Coach Saban himself. This story about the university being greedy jerks was actually not the entire reason I stopped being a fan. There is so much more that happened not involving the house situation that Alabama would probably threaten to sue me if I told and the story reached enough people. 

To summarize- Alabama is greedy, there’s another story I may tell one day including names (Coach Saban and other members of the coaching staff were jerks in that story), I went from being a HUGE Alabama fan and sport artist celebrating them to absolutely despising the university, Coach Saban, and everything they stand for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/khbnta/a_story_for_those_who_hate_alabama_from_a_former/,PriscillaW8,1,2020-12-21 01:19:36,36,/r/auburn/comments/khbnta/a_story_for_those_who_hate_alabama_from_a_former/

kk4yqn,Do Better Auburn!,"Most Black Auburn students don't feel welcomed there.  I've been hearing for years that Auburn is ungodly hostile to minorities groups especially African-Americans and LGBT people (i.e. anybody considered ""different"") which explains why it has remained overwhelmingly White and ""conservative"" (dog whistle for hateful and intolerant) in a very diverse 2020 America.

Auburn will never be a well respected institution outside Alabama (or win a football or basketball championship) if the campus climate remains SO firmly stuck in the 1960s.  I've never heard anyone mention Auburn among the likes of University of California at Berkeley, University of Virginia, UNC Chapel Hill, University of Texas at Austin ... you know world-respected public institutions that have way more progressive and inclusive reputations.

kszuxq,"Separating from the Army in May, Currently in a Stressful Dilemma. I want to transfer to AU, could use some helpful advice please!","Hello, my name is Zach Giddens, I’m 22 years old and currently serving in the U.S. Army and going to online community college wanting to transfer to Auburn.

I just wanna start by saying, it’s currently 4AM and my sleep schedule is all jacked up so I’m pulling an all nighter. Stuck in deep thoughts of my next 4 months before I move back home to Alabama. If you’re taking the time to read this and could throw some realistic and helpful advice to me. I’d really appreciate it more than anything because it’s been hard finding answers.

I am currently stationed in Fort Drum, NY. It’s right at 17 degrees outside right now with mountains of snow. I’ve been in the Army for 3 years now, my goals after high school were to go to college and get my bachelors degree in Graphic Design so I could follow my dreams in the Sports Creative world, make art and follow my passion for sports. 

Ended up not applying myself in high school and fell behind. So I guess you could say I had to take an alternate route to achieve my dreams. I joined the Army after being graduated for 2 years. Joined in 2018, been stuck in Fort Drum ever since. My entire plan was to finish out my contract so I could get 100% on my G.I. Bill and go to my dream school. 

I’ve brushed up on my research, talked to the Veteran Association down there. I some what understand the steps I need to take to get there. But in my case, there’s always a challenge or a road block I have to face and figure out. I am currently enrolled in a community college called John Wood located in Illinois. I was told that if I finish up this semester with 10 credits and take 3 summer classes to get to 19 credits and try to apply for Auburn using my GI Bill and the credits I have, I should be able to transfer in the fall. I’m not hanging onto to that to be 100% true though. 

With all that too, I am married as well. That in itself has been a battle with my wife, because she is refusing to move to Auburn. Every time I bring up going to Auburn, it’s an argument and I feel like I can’t ever win it. She proceeds to tell how bad of an idea it would be to just jump into a University only doing two semesters at a community college after being out of high school for 5 years and how would I even be accepted. She’s about to finish her Paralegal degree in May as well and plans to go further with school getting a degree in criminal defense and becoming a Defense Attorney. 

My original plans after I get out of the Army; I was going to get my CDL while still in the Army through the transitions program they have here and get home to drive truck on a guaranteed job with the family company and still have a income while doing community college online. My wife was going to work in Paralegal office. Figuring out the move home and finding a place to live near the work place, we were going to work up until it was time that we had a decent amount of money in the bank and I knew that I was definitely able to go to Auburn. 

I just came back up here from Christmas leave and I had a long talk with my mom about my plans. I feel like I need to change them, but then again. I’m scared if I do that everything will fall flat and I’m just terrified of getting out the Army and failing myself. She told me that I really need to focus on my school and follow my dreams through because I’ve wanted to do this since I was 15 years old. That if sacrificing for struggling for the next couple of years to do school to achieve the life I want to live and my dream career. Not to work a temporary job doing something that I know I don’t wanna do and letting my dream slip away from me, I would be failing myself already. 

My goals for once I get to Auburn are working towards getting an internship through the Creative Program so I could do graphic design and gain the experience in college athletics, specifically football but would be willing to take anything. I want to get my Bachelor’s for Graphic Design and graduate, get hired on and make graphics permanently and start my career there.

My mom said something about using my VA Home loan on a house close to Auburn like the Dadeville area so I wouldn’t be so far from campus when I get home in May. My only concerns are for me if I was to go the other route are, how am I going to afford a house payment if I’m not working? My wife doesn’t even have a guaranteed job. How am I going to get income? What am I suppose to do for those breaks in between semesters because the GI Bill only covers housing allowance while I’m in school. Like what am I only going to do? I had my original plans set for over a year and a half and they were solid. But my personal conflicting issue is, I just want to get to Auburn as soon as I can and start working towards my degree.

But I’m going to go ahead and close this out, I know it’s been fairly lengthy and I apologize. This has just been something that’s been weighing heavily on my mind and it could leave some life changing events for me once my time comes to separate from the Army. Please if you feel like you could give me advice on how I can make my situation better I would highly appreciate it. I just want more insight on my next moves, thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/kszuxq/separating_from_the_army_in_may_currently_in_a/,giddeyy,1,2021-01-08 05:25:47,22,/r/auburn/comments/kszuxq/separating_from_the_army_in_may_currently_in_a/
kt4c33,Anybody got video of the old Hill's Jewelry commercials from around 2010?,"For whatever reason it popped into my head while I was in bed last night and I started cracking up. Googling only turns up one of their commercials from the 90s. The one I'm thinking about in particular featured a women who, if you're blind, was dressed like a police officer and ""pulls over"" a car with a couple of young women in it. The driver mentions how she can't afford a ticket because ""she's just a college student"" and the ""cop"" asks her what the random pile of jewelry on her console is, getting the reply ""oh, that's just some old scrap gold"" which, wouldn't you know, you can get cash for at Hill's Jewelry.

  
There was another one with the same woman where she kind of appears to jump out of a helicopter or something, I forget.

ktzl7p,Scholarship Chances?,"Prospective Student Questions

I am a prospective student, currently a junior in high school, graduating in 2022. I am from Illinois and want to go somewhere far and new &amp; exciting for college. However, out of state tuition can be a bit of a kicker when choosing schools, especially given that I want to go into med.. That being said, I think I may have a decent chance at receiving a scholarship at Auburn when i apply in Fall 2021. If you have received an OOS scholarship let me know what it was/how you got it/ how your stats compare to mine. Note: If you’re comparing your stats to mine, I will definitely not qualify for any need-based financial aid, it will all have to be merit-based. Thank you so much! 

Stats...

•Ethnicity/Finances: Upper-middle class white Female (yearly household income of 250k+, meaning my scholarships will be based mainly off academic achievement)

•GPA: 4.5/4.0 weighted, 4.0 unweighted

•ACT/SAT: took my first act in October, got a 31. Have been studying extremely hard and am taking it 3 more times, hoping to end with a 34-35. Have not taken the SAT yet, my school administers it in March-April.

•Class Ranks: My school does not do class rank, but they do release percentages around graduation pertaining to Cum Laude (top 25%) Magna Cum Laude (top 10%) and Summa Cum Laude (top 5%). I go to a fairly large and very smart school. (my sister graduated in 2020 with a 4.8 and was only in Magna Cum Laude) My class has around 730 graduating students, the school has around 3500-4000 total students.

•Extracurriculars

-Student Council Representative

However, I need an additional $10,000 in merit aid ($26,000 total) to afford Auburn. I have top stats and I'm a finance major. I did the scholarship application through AUSOM and had really great ECs and essays. Is it reasonable to expect $10K+ beyond the automatic merit scholarships?** 

Hi everyone! I'm a high school senior and I'm really interested in Auburn. According to my stats, I should be eligible for the Presidential Scholarship which is $16,500 per year. I also filled out the Scholarship Application through AUSOM. 

Because my parents can only contribute around $20,000 per year, and the direct cost of Auburn is about $46,000, I would need $26,000 in merit aid every year. I have no eligibility for financial aid because my family's EFC is almost twice the cost of Auburn. 

So, is there any realistic possibility that I could get around $10K (or more) from the competitive merit scholarships through AUSOM? I applied as a finance major in Harbert BTW. 

I have other colleges that would be much cheaper than Auburn and they are better ranked than Auburn, but I do really love Auburn and hope it will be affordable.

l6ozz6,Genealogist: I will discover your Alabama ancestors and create your family tree!," Hi everyone!

I will create a personal digital family tree for you! 

$25 - Maternal Side

$25 - Paternal Side 

$50 - Full Family Tree (Both Sides)

[Family Tree Interest Form - Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/2/d/1CdcKqvVE1occbUFR8jNT8yaIMUsgik7CMKWHkZ2wMSw/edit#response=ACYDBNjD2OERoeWaXlJuYYsq7fA8gocowXl1SusFLr_NuyOMZCjLZwt4M1fN6YmVc9ChPF0)

I research back 6 generations to start and charge $1 per ancestor beyond that. I am currently accepting projects for European descent, as I have not been adequately trained in other regions yet.

My instagram is IG: heritage.hunters . Please feel free to give me a follow and check out my previous projects.

To start, I would just need as much information as you are comfortable sharing about your family history. I will not require personal information- only names and general regions of origin. I will use these to find census records, death indexes, etc.

I worked at the research branch of Ancestry.com for a year and have been professionally trained in genealogy. I also have a degree in Anthropology, which helps with research strategies. I have made hundreds of family trees and would be happy to provide examples of my work.

Venmo or Paypal are preferred. Please let me know if you are interested or have any questions. If you are still waiting on a current project, do not worry! I am planning to finish those up before I start new projects.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/l6ozz6/genealogist_i_will_discover_your_alabama/,pink_suitcase,0,2021-01-28 00:26:54,1,/r/auburn/comments/l6ozz6/genealogist_i_will_discover_your_alabama/

While i was only halfway the crosswalk the driver decided to go and hit me with the driver side of his vehicle. I told him we were going to call the cops and file a report, he decided to drive off.

TLDR: I got hit by a car while walking and the driver drove away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/lfiuta/to_the_guy_that_hit_me_today/,xPiscesxQueenx,1,2021-02-08 13:56:14,18,/r/auburn/comments/lfiuta/to_the_guy_that_hit_me_today/

Most of my issues stem from the lady that actually delivers the mail, but if I ever need anything on site they never answer the phone.

If any of y'all know of any place that sounds like I'd be a good fit, please let me know. I've already looked into the only Western barn I could find in Auburn/Opelika (Rolling Ridge) and while its a very nice barn, we weren't a good fit for each other.

ln8ot9,Some Specific Question about the Computer Science Program,"I’m trying to figure out where I want to go to college at the moment and Auburn is currently leading the pack. I have really liked what I have heard about the Computer Science program so far but I still have a few questions about some specific things within the program. 

1. What would you say the percentage split is for how many CompSci classes are primarily based around theory in comparison to how many CompSci classes are primarily based around physically writing code and programs?

2. While doing research on the program I found out about the fact that Auburn has a fully online CompSci degree that is an option separate from the on-campus degree. I intend to do the on-campus degree but seeing this made me worried that the online degree might lower companies views of Auburn CompSci graduates as a whole.

losxjk,Anybody else have any ghostly experiences in RBD Library?,"I don't consider myself a believer in anything supernatural, but had a couple encounters on the fourth floor of RBD that I can't really explain. The first one was back last semester fall of 2020. The second was a few weeks ago. Both times were late at night, both times there was no one around me in sight, and both were with what I believe to be a young female figure. 

The first encounter last semester was the first night where they extended the hours to 2 A.M. instead of 12 A.M. and I had a test the next day so I thought I would chug a monster and stay until they closed. I would regularly take breaks from studying and walk around the entire fourth floor, and I didn't notice anyone else on the floor at the time, and I am confident I was the only one on the floor. I was in one of the stacks of books and I heard a girl having an awfully loud giggle around the corner (and if you don't know the fourth floor of the library is a silence zone) so I slowly poked my head around the corner, and of course there was no one there. There was a study room way in the back of the stacks so I assumed there was a girl in there being rowdy, so I disregard. Seconds later I picked up a book and I feel a cold breeze on my neck and then suddenly I heard a whisper in my ear from a female voice. It was inaudible, I had no idea what she was trying to say. Sure enough, there was no one near me. I picked up my bag that was across the fourth floor and I left. I was scared.

If you have been to the fourth floor you might have noticed the desks up there that have those screens that you can open and close, and when they are closed you can still see the figures of things, it is just kind of blurry. And the screens are short enough so that if you sat up you could see over them no problem. By this time I had thought about my encounter a lot, and I go up there to that part of the library nearly every day, so I had pretty much conquered my fear. I'm sitting at one of these desks, again it was pretty late on a Friday, probably around 12 A.M. so there were not many people there. Again, I take breaks and I walk around the floor and I notice there are a good 3 or 4 people on the floor and people in the study rooms, but no one around me in the vicinity. So I am writing on a piece of paper and I am keeping my head down. And I shit you not, when I look up a see a dark, kind of grayish figure swiftly walking across in front of me through the blurry screen. I watched this feminine figure walk for at least five seconds straight and I thought ""I know that when I look over this desk there won't be anything there."" What do you think was there? Nothing. Nobody. The room was empty except for me. But I knew who else was there.

Told a few people about this, no one I know has had any type of this kind of thing happen to them before. Anyone else have this kind of experience in the library?",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/losxjk/anybody_else_have_any_ghostly_experiences_in_rbd/,colonelween,1,2021-02-21 03:46:45,12,/r/auburn/comments/losxjk/anybody_else_have_any_ghostly_experiences_in_rbd/

The idea is to help students learn what internships are like at different companies and find positions that offer the experiences a student is looking for. We've already grown over 500 review from companies like Boeing, Amazon, John Deere, Honeywell, and NCR.

I thought I'd throw it in here if y'all would find it useful too! The site is [canarystudent.com](https://canarystudent.com/). We've really focused on user privacy as much as we can (your name/email is never displayed or shared with the review. Ever.) Also we're actively developing, so don't hesitate to reach out via DM with suggestions or leave a comment on what you think of the platform.

Would y'all use something like this if we keep growing? Appreciate any feedback - thanks guys!",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/lw6yyy/ratemyprofessors_for_internships_new_platform_by/,SterlingRalph,1,2021-03-02 12:05:44,18,/r/auburn/comments/lw6yyy/ratemyprofessors_for_internships_new_platform_by/

lx5fuv,"Admissions Decision Advice: Calling all AU, Alabama, Virginia Tech, NC State and FSU students/grads","I'm reaching out in hopes of soliciting some insight and advice.  My son has Caleb has been accepted to Auburn and a few other schools (Alabama, Virginia Tech, NC State, Florida State and UCF) for mechanical engineering.  We've toured all the campuses except Virginia Tech.  Hands down, Auburn is his first choice and honestly it was my favorite campus to visit.  People were awesome,  our tour guide was great, and his admissions counselor has been really helpful and responsive. He wants to do either automotive engineering or theme park engineering from a career perspective.  Auburn has both an automotive engineering group and a theme park engineering groups (as do all the Florida schools and Virginia Tech).  As is generally the case in life, if money was no object, he'd go to Auburn and be thrilled about it.  However, money does play a part int he decision process and Auburn is the only school where he's received nothing in terms of scholarship money.  He can go to the in-state schools (We live in Orlando) for under $4000 a year after his grant and scholarship money.  He got $20k a year at Virginia Tech, $18k at Alabama and $10k at NC State which all help bring the price down from around $40k per year to a more manageable place.  

I'd love any insight from anyone on the topic, especially someone who may have transferred to or from Auburn from another school or to another school.  Student debt is the real deal and I'm going to help him as much as I can, but at the same time I want to be somewhat practical in the process.  I look forward to your input.

m5h7ju,Track Your Homework Using my iOS App,"Hey there, I am the developer of B4Grad, a mobile app I started developing while I was doing my undergrad.

[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/b4grad-your-student-agenda/id1352751059?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/b4grad-your-student-agenda/id1352751059?mt=8)

B4Grad has since grown and we got a major boost by the pandemic that the world has been facing.

We are looking for students to test the product as we launch several new features this upcoming semester including our note editor. You can send us the feedback via email or write a review on the App Store. That’s it.

And in exchange, we’ll give you the premium version of the app for free. It’s that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit.

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn’t good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has. 

Thank you 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/m5h7ju/track_your_homework_using_my_ios_app/,b4grad,1,2021-03-15 05:51:58,0,/r/auburn/comments/m5h7ju/track_your_homework_using_my_ios_app/

meqeu3,Update: Alabama Legislature's Expansion of Police Wiretaps,"For those who have not heard, the Alabama State House passed a bill that will enable local law enforcement officers to make wiretaps on suspected drug offenders (**without the consultation of federal agencies as is currently required)**. This is a privilege that can be abused to infringe our liberties as American citizens. 

The bill, HB17, has now been referred to a Senate Committee where it must be approved by both the committee and the state Senate as a whole to become law. Additionally, there is a Senate version of the bill, SB71, that has been referred to another Senate Committee. 

The **only** way to stop this bill is a large outcry from Alabamians, so I urge those concerned with personal liberties to read, sign, and share this [petition](https://www.change.org/p/alabama-state-house-stand-against-alabama-law-enforcement-s-use-of-wiretaps) that explains the bill more in-depth, and contact your state Senator (who you can find [here](https://cqrcengage.com/alabama/?0)) to voice your opposition to both HB17 and SB71.

mjl6lz,Prospective Student with some questions,"Hey everyone! I’m a high school senior from Georgia and Auburn is one of the schools I’m considering attending next year. I’ll be majoring in engineering, though for something more specific than that I’m undecided between electrical, aerospace, mechanical, and civil. I was also admitted into the honors college. At this point the others I’m looking at are Alabama, Clemson, and Florida. If anyone here chose Auburn over any of those places I would appreciate some thoughts on that. I toured the campus not too long and really liked it, and the scholarships they have awarded me have made it a feasible option. Just had a few questions for you guys, hopefully this is allowed!

1) How are the career resources here, both as a whole and for engineering? Are there quality career fairs where you can find internships/co-ops/jobs for after graduation? 

2) What is the housing like? I have the opportunity to join either the honors LLC or the engineering LLC, what are these like?

3) Are you glad that you came here? Do you have any regrets about your choice?

4) Anything you wish you knew before attending Auburn?

I greatly appreciate any answers I can get for these. Trying to make a tough decision here!

I’m more open about political disagreements for finances/economics than social issues. So I’m wondering if you are socially left or right? 

If you can, please also let me know in the comments if you’re in graduate school and especially if you’re in physics/aerospace engineering. I will respect everyone, but I’m curious.

mk01bh,"Transfer, saying hello!","What's up boys (and girls, of course),

Just transferred here from VT, planning to come down in a month or so for Summer 2021 to try and get a feel of the town and get some classes out of the way. Wanted to pique community interest on a number of things, as well as say what's up.

I'm really big into mountain biking, yoga, and working out, so I figured I'd start with those. If anyone has any good ideas for mountain biking trails nearby and also some yoga studios, please shoot those my way. Ordinarily, I'd go on TripAdvisor or something but I have found that hearing from Reddit communities of towns and universities has yielded better results, at least in my experiences. Is the student gym good for weightlifting and have good hours? Debating whether I should use the gym provided or branch out and pay a bit for a gym membership off-campus. 

I'm all vaccinated and ready to get some warmer weather and hopefully get over this pandemic -- safely &amp; socially distanced. I've heard a lot about Skybar, so I figured I'd swing by and check that out. If there's anything else you'd recommend, please let me know. Just trying to get a feel of the town.

P.S. -- if any of you are in town over the summer and want to come by my house to crank a few beers or talk about artisan coffee, let me know. Look forward to being a part of this community.

mm0szp,Taking summer classes is so crappy,"Posting this here because I figured someone else probably will have the same experience in the coming days.

I had a 5 course load planned out this summer - Software Modeling and Design, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Ethics, and a COMP elective I was going to choose from the ones available.

Well, turns out Software Modeling and Design isn't even offered in the summer, so I swapped it out with Computer Networks.

Tiger Scheduler told me that Computer Ethics was at the same time as one of the others, and since the only options for both were in-person or online synchronous (virtual, attendance required), I had to drop that one.

The COMP electives offered this summer are so bad too, theres like an IOS class and a Database Systems 1 that has like a 1 star professor attached to it. Why is the university giving the worst schedules in the summer? IOS it is then.

Now I am dealing with the registration site not even accepting my registration for Computer Networks in the second summer term because I don't have the necessary prerequisite -&gt; Operating Systems. I am taking Operating Systems in the first summer term!

Why would I spend money to return to school and only take 2 major courses plus a COMP elective if I'm in my 3rd year here? What a waste.

I've already emailed all the proper people and everything, just wanted to share my frustration. It's honestly not even worth taking classes at Auburn over the summer when this is what it looks like.

I'm a student at Auburn but my major is nowhere near the art department. And I have no idea how to even start inquiring about this... so here I am 🤣

I'm a 22 yo female, 5 7 and 145 lbs, if that matters? I'm not sure.

na8y2p,Looking for a place to live,"Hey guys,

My friend (F32) is relocating from Kentucky and is looking for a small house or apartment to live (preferably an apartment with only a few units). 

Her budget is 800-850$ a month and she’s got all the furniture she needs to furnish a place. 

She doesn’t want to sublet a place to end out someone else’s lease (and just move all over again).

She’d also prefer to live alone. 

The issue she’s running into is that most places won’t let her sign a lease until August. She would happily be on a month-to-month or year-long lease, but it won’t help if she can’t move in anywhere until August. 

Do any of you have any leads I could share with her? 

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/na8y2p/looking_for_a_place_to_live/,heckenyaax,1,2021-05-11 17:59:21,9,/r/auburn/comments/na8y2p/looking_for_a_place_to_live/

nis3ft,Don't Believe That Your Voice Does Not Matter,"Oftentimes, I see people (especially in the state of Alabama) who don't think that their voice will do anything to affect our government. That our government is controlled by dark money and special interest groups, and we, as average citizens, cannot influence the legislative process. There's definitely truth to this position, but the only way to try to change the status quo is by making our voices heard in whatever way possible.

In response to an Alabama State House bill, HB17, that would make it easier for local law enforcement officers to make wiretaps on suspected drug offenders (*without the consultation of federal agencies as is currently required*), I started a [petition](https://www.change.org/stop_wiretaps). The specifics as to why the bill was a bad idea can be found [there](https://www.change.org/stop_wiretaps). Because of pressure put on our legislators from people who viewed the petition *and then contacted their legislators* (contacting your legislators is what actually will have an impact - especially at the state level), the bill stalled in committee as the legislative session ended - effectively deeming the bill dead.

Would the bill have died in committee without an outcry from Alabamians? Perhaps, in fact, it's likely that it would have since that's the outcome of most bills. However, it is undeniable that the phone calls and emails that our representatives received from concerned citizens around the state contributed to the bill's death (especially because of its low-profile nature).

The takeaway from this is one thing: When you see injustice in our government, whatever form it may manifest, do *not* stand idly by with the belief that you will have no impact. Instead, make sure that you speak against the injustice and spread awareness. After all, our government is one of, by, and for the people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/nis3ft/dont_believe_that_your_voice_does_not_matter/,Aubynator,1,2021-05-22 17:05:11,22,/r/auburn/comments/nis3ft/dont_believe_that_your_voice_does_not_matter/

nlv1ds,I developed a mental health related app from my personal experience!,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend.

They are now contacting me and telling me that they will be canceling my move in until I pay the security deposit to the tenant. They are putting an actual charge on my account now which I prefer, but it almost feels like they just spent the previous tenants security deposit and are waiting on me to reimburse him, which is totally illegal. They seemed very defensive when I questioned them about it. I just want to know if this is common practice to have tenants Venmo previous tenants their security deposit?

Also would coming to auburn be a culture shock..l heard it’s a school that is more old money and southern as opposed to University of Alabama.

If I were to go with Media Studies, I'd be graduating Fall 2022 - Spring 2023, whereas if I went with the Visual curriculum it'd be about a year or so longer.

Really looking for opinions from those who are/graduated from either majors or know people who did and could help me decide which to pursue. The Visual path would have more hands on experience, but I'm not sure if those are things I could learn on my own time or if it would be more beneficial to take the classes.

I'm a student looking to buy a stick shift car. I've driven stick probably 2 times, and those 2 times went fine but I wouldn't say I know how to drive one, they were in parking lots or back home in my small town.

(yes i know this is short notice so if it doesn't happen it doesn't happen)   
I'm searching for someone that wouldn't mind teaching me at least the basics of how to drive a stick (for like 30 minutes to an hour) at like noon today, so an hour and a half after i made this post. I don't mind filling your car with gas and paying like $10 or $15 cash just for helping me out.

Also kinda looking for someone that has a car, not a truck, since I've been told they drive very differently in a manual transmission.

nz6ghx,Chicken Finger Restaurant Tier List (Open Discussion),"Figured we need this with all the various chicken places around. I know this is a heated debate so I am open to change the list depending on yall's comments.

My Personal List:

S Tier:  *Guthrie's*

IMO Guthrie's does everything right. Great chicken, not soggy fries, banging sauce, good toast. A clear S tier. 

A Tier: *Zaxby's, Foosackly's* 

Zaxby's is the classic. Decent but greasy chicken, seasoned but (most of the time) soggy fries, great sauce. Toast is generally identical to Guthrie's. Overall super greasy but you can't go wrong. Foosackly's is where we start to see some polarization in opinion. They are praised for their prices but if you include a drink in your order the prices are right back to where every other chicken place is. The chicken is good and not greasy, the fries are not soggy, but could use seasoning, and the toast is a toss up. The sauce is good.  It's the newest and most popular.

B Tier:  *Louie's*

Louie's. A coworker brought me here one time and honestly I have never been to a more generic, flavorless establishment in all my time. The food all blended together in a mash of blandness never before seen in the likes of a chicken place. 

F Tier: *Tenda Chick*

I am scared for my life of the rat sized roaches in Tenda Chick. This place hasn't been cleaned since the 80's and feels like a knockoff of Zaxby's without all the redeeming qualities. You can get better chicken from the frozen Tyson bags you get at Walmart, the fries are mush and they give you bread butts for the toast. 

Not Listed: Jim Bob's Christian Chicken; I haven't tried it

He has been wandering in the neighborhood for some time and sightings by neighbors suggest he no longer has a home. We are going to try and look for an owner for another week or so - and then begin to try finding him a place to go. 

We would keep him in an absolute heartbeat if we weren’t already at capacity and moving soon in July. Looking to possibly rehome him permanently or at the very least have someone who could foster him while we move and get into our new home at which time I could come back and get him. 

Super affectionate boy, talkative and total lap-kitty! Very good with dogs and cats. He’s been with our cat for two days and they’re warming up fairly easily. Litter trained. We have named him “Eivor” for the time being.

ol1izp,Auburn University considering hybrid remote work,"Auburn has formed a steering committee to explore whether we should institute some form of approved remote/hybrid work for certain segments of the university. We learned a great deal about working remotely during the pandemic. Moving forward, this committee is examining how remote/hybrid work could function more permanently while ensuring that we still provide a world-class and robust residential learning experience for our students.

The committee has recommended that a limited number of approved pilot groups begin testing remote/hybrid work options on Aug. 1. The committee is working with leadership and supervisors to vet and establish these groups. Testing will continue throughout the fall semester and officially end on Dec. 31. Participating employees and positions must meet a series of established factors for consideration. Supervisors and employees who do not wish to participate can decline the invitation.

The steering committee has formed multiple work groups to establish the guidelines, processes and resources needed to implement the pilot program. The committee will also thoroughly track and assess the program’s effectiveness to determine future recommendations.  

Please note that before we can assume broader flexibility in where and how people work, we must establish infrastructure and logistics to best serve our students and employees. Regardless of how work is performed, we will still provide a superior on-campus experience for our students, and ensure that any changes ultimately benefit the university.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/ol1izp/auburn_university_considering_hybrid_remote_work/,irregardlesslike,1,2021-07-15 16:44:11,14,/r/auburn/comments/ol1izp/auburn_university_considering_hybrid_remote_work/

Long story short I quickly moved last October to November into a home leased by 360 Management. I contacted them this week asking about getting my pet - deposit back because I wound up not actually living there because I had to take care of my parents (my mom has cancer). I still paid rent until the lease was up in case my mom got better and I could move back. 

First I was told ""as the lease states it is not a refundable deposit"", then I pointed out my lease says nothing about a non-refundable pet deposit. 

Then they said I never paid a pet deposit. So I sent them a full screenshot of my ledger (the one I inserted is cropped to hide any sensitive information).

ozb5ek,PSA: Tiger Card Balance expires today (Aug 6),"If you have $120 or more you can try the Home Chef option. Here's the info on that:

Home Chef is a meal delivery service supplying weekly deliveries of fresh, perfectly portioned ingredients and chef designed recipes. You can use your dining dollars to pay for these meal kits. Each meal kit cost $120 and provides approximately 5 – 8 meals.
 
 Home Chef has a variety of meal options to select from. Students with dietary restrictions can customize their meal kits, selecting choices that are safe for them. You’ll choose the date you want your meal kit delivered and the address you want it delivered to. The meal kits can be delivered anywhere in the United States to whomever you want. Basic appliances (stove / oven) and cooking equipment (pots and pans) are needed to prepare the food as well as common cooking ingredients like spices and olive oil.
 
 You’ll purchase the meal kit from the Grubhub app. To use your dining dollars to purchase the Home Chef vouchers, make sure that your payment method is listed as “Declining Balance”. Go to the ""AU Campus"" pickup options on Grubhub.  Even though it says “pickup”, you will not actually pick up the Home Chef vouchers. Home Chef is listed as a dining location between AU Smokehouse and AU Success Shop. Upon viewing your order, you’ll see an address listed, but please disregard that address, as you are not picking up the voucher.
 
Grubhub will send you a verification email which may take several days to be emailed to you. Please check your spam or junk mail folders, if it doesn’t arrive in your inbox within a week or so.

p0ulvc,are greek organizations held to state labor laws?,"im visiting my friend in auburn for the week and her sorority seems to be holding her to unlawful labor hours/standards. she's supposed to be at her designated location for 12-14 hours a day, with a 10 minute lunch break (on site).

i get that these are voluntary organizations that thousands of girls pay big bucks to be included in or even considered, but state laws require 30 minutes of break per 8 hours of work (and more if the shift is longer).

im clueless when it comes to greek life and law... but something seems really screwed up here. she's afraid to take bathroom breaks, for christ's sake! i don't have any intentions for this post other than getting my frustrations out there :/

p4wgzn,Auburn scrimmage intel," Scrimmage Intel:  
 

	The scrimmage was “thud”, not full tackling.  
 

	The EDGE player look good. In particular, Romello Height has great quickness.  
 

	Jarquez Hunter did not participate.  
 

	Shaun Shivers and Donovan Kaufman were the first-team kick returners.  
 

	Nehemiah Pritchett and Ladarrius Tennison were the second team kickoff returners.  
 

	The scrimmage began with 2’s versus 2’s.  
 

	There was constant artificial crowd noise pumped into Jordan-Hare Stadium.  
 

	Kaufman was the first team nickel, with Smoke Monday and Zion Puckett  at safety. Kaufman later comes out when Chandler Wooten comes in as the  extra linebacker. That’s something we talked about on The Corner, the  nickel and extra linebacker rotation.  
 

	Kaufman also played safety, and Tennison moved to nickel. When Tennison  left the field, Cam Riley came onto the field at linebacker.  
 

	Bo Nix completed a 41-yards skinny post on third down early in the  scrimmage. Nix hit another 30-yarder on third down, completing a double  move to Ze’Vian Capers over Pritchett. It was a well-timed throw and a  great catch.  
 

	There were a “lot” of false start penalties early in the scrimmage.  
 

	Shivers scored a touchdown a few players later from one yard out.  
 

	The first two drives for TJ Finley were three-and-outs. Finley missed a  corner route to Tar’Varish Dawson. Finley had another drive that went  to third-and-one, and the first team defense stopped the second team  offense on third and fourth downs, with Zakoby McClain making a big stop  against walk-on back Sean Jackson.  
 

	Nix keeps the sticks moving on third-and-three, but follows that up  with an interception by Jaylin Simpson. Nix escaped to his right and  threw it up for grabs. It wasn’t a good decision.  
 

	Pritchett notches an interception due to miscommunication between Nix  and a wideout. The wideout stopped the route and Nix threw deep.  
 

	Later on, Nix overthrew Luke Deal on a wide open attempt from the  pocket. He was then sacked by Colby Wooden. The defense really had the  offense’s number tonight.  
 

	Dematrius Davis entered the game with the third team offense against  the third team defense. Davis looked good on zone-read plays and outruns  the EDGE to the corner, moving the chains on a scramble. Davis then  threw a beautiful deep fade to the corner from 30 yards out. There was  pass interference on the defense.  
 

	Davis is stepping into and through the pocket to scramble, where Nix  bails to his right. (I saw Davis do the same thing during 11-on-11 work  the other day. He stepped up and through the pocket. It’s instincts.)  Davis then threw a 21-yard touchdown to Jackson Billings.  
 

	Per one insider, Davis “outperformed” Finley by a “wide margin”. Davis had another great pass to Landen King that was dropped.  
 

	Then the scrimmage shifted to working from the 25-yard line in.  
 

	Finley came back and threw a touchdown to Elijah Canion from 25 yards out. Canion beat backup corner Devin Guice.  
 

	Nix came in against the first team defense and the offense ran four  straight play action plays. The defense covered them all up, including a  sack by Wooden.  
 

	Sean Jackson had some nice runs, breaking a few tackles, including an attempt by J.J. Pegues in the backfield.  
 

	Pegues flashed with some plays in the backfield. (Like we talked about  on the podcast, he’s going to make some “wow” plays even before the  light completely comes on at defensive tackle.)  
 

	Finley doesn’t appear to be as good when the play breaks down as Nix or Davis.  
 

	Zakoby McClain is a “baller”, including a takedown of Tank Bigsby in the backfield.  
 

	The secondary looked solid. There are athletes everywhere. The EDGE players all played well.  
 

	Jordon Ingram with a 24-yard touchdown run on a great cut 10 yards  downfield. It was second team offense against third team defense.  
 

	Takeaways  
 	If the defensive front can hold up against the run, they will be very  good. The secondary is talented and performed well. The EDGE and  linebackers are explosive as well. If Auburn can play good first and  second down rush defense, they’ll be in business.  
 

	Dematrius Davis watched his stock rise tonight. He’s calm and “legit”,  one sources said. TJ Finley wasn’t bad either. Bo Nix didn’t have the  kind of night he probably would have hoped.  
 

	In Nix’s defense, there’s still too much pressure coming through the  offensive line. He’s still improving, but the pressure being allowed  from the offensive line has to be dealt with.  
 

	Zion Puckett is a player we haven’t talked about much, but he will have  a role. He’s big and runs smoothly. Oddly enough, Bydarrius Knighten  and Dreshun Miller didn’t get mentioned much as standing out.  
 

	The offense is still mostly shotgun, with under center coming in short yardage.  
 

	The Harsin-Bobo offense will feature lots of pre-snap motion and shifts. Think back to Al Borges in 2004.  
 

	The receivers will be fine. If there’s time to throw, they can make plays.  
 

	Sean Jackson, the walk-on back, may be ahead of Jordon Ingram. We aren’t sure where Jarquez Hunter was, but Jackson is a load.  
 

	The offensive line, like I mentioned the other day, needs to find the  starting five and start giving them reps together as a unit. The  cross-training is fine, but that group needs reps as a unit ASAP.  
 

	Under the radar guys to keep watching out for our Romello Height, Eku Leota, Puckett and TD Moultry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/p4wgzn/auburn_scrimmage_intel/,Ok-Recognition7077,1,2021-08-15 12:18:45,9,/r/auburn/comments/p4wgzn/auburn_scrimmage_intel/

1) Supplemental Instruction - almost all math courses up to calculus 2 have some sort of supplemental instruction. You may have noticed a leader in your own class. As someone who SI’d for 5 semesters, I would highly recommend giving it a try if you struggle as it’s free help. The leaders for your course levels should be setting up times for you in the next week or so.

2) engineering tutoring services - this is a service located in Shelby (or it used to be) and I worked there over a summer semester. It’s free 1-on-1 tutoring in whatever course they will offer. You set the appointment time and go from there.

3) finally, me - I’ve been tutoring throughout my 6 years at Auburn in several math courses from Pre-Cal to Differential Equations. With classes coming back on campus, I’m looking forward to being able to tutor once again. I wanted to let people know of the free options before putting a private tutoring post out there.

pbdpvf,I made RateMyProfessors but for classes," Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/Auburn) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in, as well as filter courses by department and level and compare these courses. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking and know what to expect.

Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add.

Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.

Enjoy!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/pbdpvf/i_made_ratemyprofessors_but_for_classes/,oopsidaisiess,1,2021-08-25 11:35:43,7,/r/auburn/comments/pbdpvf/i_made_ratemyprofessors_but_for_classes/

If you like big-ass-speakers, vinyl, tape, amplifiers, old music, and snacks… and ESPECIALLY if you collect any of these things, this is the club for you. I’m making a Facebook group soon, where announcements will be posted and where communication and planning can take place! 

The idea is that once or twice a month, the group will meet at a host’s house to listen to music and eat snacks/dinner for an hour or two. 

If you’re interested, send me a message and tell me a little bit about yourself: the type of music you like, and what you listen on! 

Now, I think I’m gonna go with the name Auburn Hi-Fi enthusiasts. Auburn Audiophiles has a nice ring to it, but it also sounds a bit creepy. Now, there are a lot of old dudes who still hang onto this hobby, but to find a college student with this interest is a rarity. If this is a success, it could be a great opportunity to socialize with other weirdos like you. So send that message!

pw6ci2,Leopard Gecko for Adoption,"So, about 4 years ago we rescued our little guy Zagreus from a craigslist ad. I don't personally feel like I'm giving him the attention he deserves and to be honest my ADHD makes it kind of hard to keep up with his needs.

I was thinking it's probably for the best to find him a new home with someone who can properly take care of him! He is a normal morph, pretty small (he was malnourished when we got him so I assume his growth was stunted) and he is missing a few of his little toes. Not handled at all so he's pretty skiddish about it and kinda bitey, but if you're determined and patient he has been handleable in the past.

Comes with his 30gal tank, light, heater, hides, everything else. Asking like $50 just to make sure whoever buys him is down for the responsibility!

I have started a new youtube channel this season where I am going over different historical events in college football. It started off as me planning on covering events that took place on specific dates in college football and is starting to evolve into me just covering historical events from any date. 

With your game vs Georgia coming up, I decided to make a video on your series against them with it being one of the oldest in college football. I hope it does this series some justice and I tried my best to be impartial. This is my first season doing this so let me know what you think and let me know if you have any suggestions.

How would you order these housing options: Village, S Donahue, 320 West Mag, Cambridge?

My son would really like a room with a door he can close. He is willing to get out and meet people, but as an introvert, also wants his own space to go back to and decompress from the day. Some of these options are pretty expensive, so we're trying to determine if the price is worth it or not.

I decided, while I was still far away enough from the masses, to prepare and ingest a single hand-rolled cigarette.

Delicious.

I was near the parking garage to the left of the stadium, when a little weird looking guy driving in a little weird looking red car stopped amidst the street. 

""No smoking in campus!""
""What's up?"" I nod my head, not sure of what he was saying. 
""There's no smoking on campus""
I look at him for a moment. Then, shrugging my shoulder, I take another deep drag of my delightful smokey treat, utterly and blatantly disregarding this man's futile rage.

Unbeknownst to him, I am no student at all; only a 3-semester dropout of an entirely different college. Therefore his efforts to expel me, might he catch me again, shall be rendered null and void. It is precisely for this reason that I shall embark back to campus in only a few moments. 

There, in a forbidden place, I will take a pinch of tobacco from my wallet, crumple it onto a thin sheet of paper, roll it up, light it on fire, and suck it down my throat. I'll be thinking of shiney bald guy when I take the first drag.

qob0ku,Housing options for a transfer student.,"I might be transferring to Auburn from an out of state cc for fall 2022. I would most likely be transferring in as a Junior. I’m a quiet guy who isn’t super social or out going however, I really want to change that when I get to college. I have never lived on campus, let alone stepped foot on my cc campus. My college experience so far, has been at home staring at my laptop for almost 1.5 years because my cc hasn’t been open since 2020. My parents are highly suggesting that I live on campus for my first year of college, even though I’ll be a Junior, because I’ve never really had the “college experience”. They seem to believe that living off campus without certain amenities, will be too quick of an environment/social change for me (idk though). They told me to “ease” into college life and my independence, whatever that means. To be fair, I’ve never lived on my own. They also decided that I will not have a vehicle for my first year, ouch!

r550e6,Pre-Med as a Nursing Major at Auburn?,"Now before you call me insane… let me explain my situation.

I am a senior in high school who was recently accepted to Auburn university as Pre-Nursing and the school is currently my top choice. I’ve been interested in healthcare since I started high school and I’ve done internships and shadowing in both Medicine and Nursing, and will also be graduating high school with Pharmacy Tech certification. Growing up in a middle class house, the importance of getting a degree with a guaranteed job(like nursing or engineering) is something ingrained into my mind, and something my parents still continue to push. Nursing offers me the ability to work in healthcare, with low risks of it “not working out” and ending up without a job to go into right after school, but I really want to be a Doctor. The risks involved with majoring in something like Biology to make pre-med easier scares me because if I don’t do good enough to get into medical school I’d end up in a field that I wouldn’t enjoy. 

Now that I’ve gotten through all of that, do you think it’d be possible to do both Nursing and the Pre-med track at Auburn? I’ve heard both are very difficult. 

Current Pre-Med / Pre-Health students, are the advising and resources available helpful? I’ve been told the Pre-Med program at Auburn is really good, but I can’t find any exact statistics to back the statements. Would the advisors likely oppose the idea of doing Nursing and the Pre-Med track?

Nursing students, do you think it will be possible to invest time into studying for the MCAT while in my Junior year(first year in the Nursing courses)?

r71pxk,Auburn Arena needs more student seating,"Auburn Arena needs more student seating (and more seating in general)

Idk how to do it, but some engineer does. Auburn Arena needs more student seating and it is painfully obvious. Wednesday night, week before exams and so many students are in attendance that they are taking up both levels of standing room only.

Ever since Auburn has taken away section D of the bleacher seats for more scholarship seats (money 🥴) it’s been a problem. 

I don’t know if Auburn Arena is too small or what, but part of it being small is it creates an amazing home court advantage. The actual seats are never filled, especially for these weeknight games, so maybe we give students a section or 2 in the middle bowl?

If you have any ideas or suggestions I would love to hear them. Or if you agree/disagree?",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/r71pxk/auburn_arena_needs_more_student_seating/,auburnfan32,1,2021-12-02 02:15:54,6,/r/auburn/comments/r71pxk/auburn_arena_needs_more_student_seating/

rzrzjw,Masking and the BB game,"This is a serious, not pot-stirring question. I would really like to hear serious responses to this. 

Not an Auburn student, but a parent.

I understand the mask mandate for indoor campus spaces has been re-instated. Classes start next week.

I looked at photos from last night's game. Hardly a mask in sight. 

Whether you think that's good or bad is not the issue (to me, right now).

I'm just wondering what the administration's 

a) rationale

and 

b) credibility

can be in allowing tens of thousands of unmasked folks to aspirate unmasked in a closed space for 3 hours but then a few days later demanding that 20 kids sitting in a classroom mask up. 

(Only to unmask, of course, in their apartments, shops, restaurants and bars)

Is that...science? Data driven? Evidence-based?",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/rzrzjw/masking_and_the_bb_game/,Emmett275,1,2022-01-09 08:43:35,0,/r/auburn/comments/rzrzjw/masking_and_the_bb_game/

Flannagan cost me ten bucks and eighty cents and Okeke cost me four bucks and fortyfour cents. now they have some of the same cards with rarer auto's of certain colors that cost more.and these being NIL i bet there are fewer of them made which means they are more attractive to collectors. anyway i just wanted to let you guys know it is a fun way to support players and they are cheap enough on some of them that just about guarantees they will grow in value. i have no idea how many players are doing this but i would suspect there are more than two. i hope some of you find this helpful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/s29z44/nil_goodies_on_ebay/,Ok-Recognition7077,1,2022-01-12 11:13:28,0,/r/auburn/comments/s29z44/nil_goodies_on_ebay/

sse2sp,Young Professional Scene at Auburn?,"I am currently 27 and essentially self employed in the Real Estate field.  My business partner went to school here and we have a lot going on in Alabama for work right now.  We are seriously considering moving to Auburn next year and opening a new branch of our company.  It makes a lot of sense for our work, geographically.  We are both currently living in Denver.   I would be working a lot, so that would take up a lot of my time, however I would still like to be physically active, and have a dating/social life outside of work. 

My biggest questions/concerns: 

\-How is the dating scene here for an older guy in his late 20s?  I'm open minded and wouldn't be opposed to dating a much younger girl in college, however I have done this before and the maturity difference made it difficult.  It seems like most people meet each other through the university, and I would not be enrolled in the university.  How easy is it to date here and meet new people if you are older, and not enrolled in the university?  Specifically as a young professional? 

\-What are the best places to live?  I'll probably buy a lake house at Lake Martin at some point, but for now I want to live close to everything.  I am fortunate enough to earn a strong income through my job, and could afford most houses in the area from what I have seen.  With that being said, I don't want to blow a bunch of money on a house in an area that I don't really enjoy.  Are there specific neighborhoods/areas that are better than others for young professionals?  

\-What do most people do on the weekends if they're not in college party mode anymore?  I know Lake Martin is nearby, and the beach is within reach as well.  What else do people do for fun here?  

Appreciate any responses and I look forward to hopefully meeting some of you next year!",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/sse2sp/young_professional_scene_at_auburn/,CMGC12345,1,2022-02-14 11:04:15,11,/r/auburn/comments/sse2sp/young_professional_scene_at_auburn/

suye29,Prospective Out of State Questions,"
Hello, I have been looking through this Reddit the past couple of weeks and have found a lot of useful information but still had some questions of my own. I am from the Upper Midwest and am almost ready to put money down for Auburn but still have a few questions. 

1. I am a Crop and Soil Science Major, wondering what kind of jobs and where a lot of Ag kids work after college, is it only in Alabama or are students competitive with large/ out of state companies? 

2. I am interested in joining a fraternity next year and got the impression that Auburn has a more chillaxed Greek Life compared to other schools in the SEC. Am I wrong with this assumption or is there fraternities who are not insane with the partying (if you could give some names of some that would be awesome!). 

3. Coming from the Upper Midwest I have heard a lot from others that I will experience a major culture shock and will not fit in. I don’t believe this personally but wanted to get the Reddit’s opinion. 

4. I have heard somethings about campus and Auburn totally shutting down when it’s not a football weekend. Is it true that everybody goes home or is there enough going on with kids on campus to have some fun. 

I know everyone doesn’t have an answer to every question but if you’re able to contribute a little bit that would be super helpful.

svbfnw,"Pharmacy dean Richard Hansen sexually harassed student, Title IX documents show","“Richard Hansen, dean of Auburn University's Harrison School of Pharmacy, was found responsible for a violation of Auburn’s Policy Against Harassment and Discrimination after sexually harassing a student at an off-campus bar last spring, according to documents received by The Plainsman.

The student, who is enrolled at Auburn University but not the pharmacy school, reported Hansen to Auburn University's Title IX Office in late September, which conducted an investigation into Hansen's behavior.


According to Title IX’s final investigative report, Hansen told her that she was “going to suck his d¡*k, gag, and keep her head down.”

“We find Hansen’s conduct toward [the student] to be severe,” the report reads. “We find Hansen’s conduct created an intimidating, hostile or offensive University environment.”


On Jan. 26, after the investigation had concluded, Title IX informed the student via an email viewed by The Plainsman that Hansen would “have a one-month suspension and other appropriate sanctions.”

However, on Feb. 9, Title IX informed the student via email that they had “mistakenly provided inaccurate information regarding sanctions to be imposed on Dean Hansen.” Neither Title IX nor the provost's office shared details of the corrective action taken to The Plainsman or to the student.

Hansen is still working in his position as dean, a position he has had since 2017.

April 25

“There was one day I was the only employee in the building, which was normal for Sundays,” the student said in an interview with The Plainsman, in reference to April 25, 2021. “And I had a group of guys, and they were like my regulars. They were in there. They're super nice. And then him and one of his friends were down at the end — other end of the bar.”

According to the student, Hansen’s friend Jason Peevy left the bar before Hansen began making inappropriate comments toward her.

According to the final investigative report, Peevy told investigators that while he did not hear Hansen make sexual comments towards the student, Hansen “gauged [the student’s] interest in him (Hansen), but [the student] was not inviting Hansen’s advances.""

“He was talking about wanting to take me home and me giving him and the other guy a blowjob,” the student said. “He went very graphic into that stuff.

“That’s when … I was like, ‘Okay, that’s harassment.’ The other stuff was like, ‘That’s disgusting.’”

The student knew that Hansen was a dean, and she said he knew who she was.

“[Hansen] would ask me about school, told me he saw me on campus a couple times,” she said. “I mean, I immediately was very stern and like, ‘You’re not going to talk to me like that,’ …and I walked away. And he actually fell asleep at the bar after two-and-a-half beers.”

She called her manager and told her what was going on before calling the general manager.

“[The general manager] basically told me to get [Hansen] out of there, so I called some other people and ended up having one of his friends come back and get him,” the student said. “And then, I guess they didn’t really do anything other than [tell] me they were going to have a conversation with him. Within two weeks, he was still doing his normal stuff.”

According to the student, Hansen would sit at the bar while she was there, which she thought would not have been allowed.

“When I stopped working there, I didn’t have a fear of losing my job anymore,” she said. “I was like, ‘Okay, I graduate in the spring. He probably can’t prevent me from graduating at this point. Let’s just go ahead and report it because this is getting out of hand.’”

Since Hansen harassed her on April 25, she said she isolated herself. She lost almost 30 pounds in only a few weeks.

On Oct. 1, a no-contact directive had been issued at the student’s request by the Title IX office, barring Hansen and the student from any means of communication. Any violation of the directive could result in corrective action.

On New Year’s Eve, he showed up at a bar she was closing with her friend.

“He came in and he sat down across from me,” she said. “My friend started asking me, ‘Why is that guy staring at you?’ So I had to report that, and of course he denied it and whatnot.”

The student said Hansen sat down, stared at her then left without buying a drink. Following this encounter, she said she became more paranoid about being followed.

After Hansen sexually harassed her, the student began avoiding places on campus that were close to the pharmacy school. She stopped going to her classes in Lowder Hall.

""The difference in power between us is the reason I didn’t come forward sooner,"" she said in a written opposition to his appeal. ""I wasn’t even sure I’d be heard if I did speak up and the power dynamic is the reason I feel so uncomfortable on campus.""

This, along with her avoidance of Lowder Hall, was evidence Title IX used in their final investigative report to claim that Hansen’s actions “created an intimidating and offensive University environment for [the student].”

When she was deciding whether or not to report Hansen, the student weighed the risks. She was not sure if he would be able to kick her out of the University or what the University would be able to do for her.

“There was so much going through my mind,” she said. “Then I was like, ‘These other girls that he definitely — he’s definitely doing stuff to other girls. And me not speaking up, that definitely didn’t sit right with me.”

Title IX

After reporting the incident to Title IX on Sept. 27, the student was quickly put in contact with the office. Within a month, the investigation was completed and the student was given the final investigation report.

Hansen appealed the ruling on Nov. 3, saying the complaint falls outside the purview of Auburn’s Policy Against Harassment and Discrimination and that Hansen’s conduct was not “objectively severe” and did not create an “intimidating, hostile or offensive University environment.” His appeal was denied.

“Hansen did not outright deny [the student’s] allegations,” the final investigation report said. “In fact, he stated he has no recollection of making the comments and making such comments are ‘uncharacteristic’ of him.”

Hansen claimed to be unable to recall other aspects of the evening of April 25, but testimony from the student and Peevy confirm them, investigators concluded.

“[Hansen] stated he did not remember any conversations being directed toward [the student]; however, Peevy stated the opposite,” the report said. “Hansen stated he does not believe he fell asleep at the bar that evening; however, [the student] stated Hansen fell asleep, Peevy stated someone called him and relayed that Hansen was asleep, and there is a photo of Hansen asleep.”

After the student was informed in January that Hansen would be suspended for a month, she thought it was over.

“I was like, ‘This is great. He’s being held accountable. At least something is being done,'” she said.

Despite this, she said she still felt the suspension was “a little bit of a slap on the wrist.” She was not told whether the suspension would be paid or unpaid, though she was later told he would not be suspended at all.

After receiving the email claiming Hansen would face a one-month suspension, the student asked Title IX if she could receive all of the related paperwork.

“And that was just ignored,” she said. “I asked [Katherine Weathers, senior deputy Title IX coordinator] why that was ignored, and she said she wasn’t sure and then assured me that they had been very timely on getting back to me about everything.”

The student said she had been revoked access to the Title IX documentation she was previously given via Box, an online file-sharing service, about the same time her friend reached out on her behalf to The Plainsman.

In a meeting with Title IX following the Feb. 9 email, which clarified that Hansen would not be suspended and that his corrective action would not be shared, the student said she was told that she would be allowed to come view the documents, but she could only get copies of the documents through a court-issued subpoena.

Differentiating Title IX

Auburn’s full Title IX policy only applies to sexual harassment that “occurs within the University’s Education Programs and Activities in the U.S.” In cases where sexual harassment between two University-affiliated individuals occurs off-campus — or on study abroad trips — the University employs its Policy Against Harassment and Discrimination instead.

Since this case was handled under the Policy Against Harassment and Discrimination instead of the Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy, there was no hearing, where a hearing officer brings the parties together to deliberate the evidence and determine any discipline to be imposed if one is determined responsible for violating this policy.

According to the Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy, the hearing officer is required to transmit a written decision to the parties following the hearing, which would include the discipline deemed appropriate for the violator of the policy. The Policy Against Harassment and Discrimination, on the other hand, does not require Title IX to notify the complainant of the discipline given.

In a meeting with Title IX, the student said she was told she would only be notified if the corrective action resulted in suspension or termination of employment.

Additionally, when faculty are found in violation of this policy, corrective action is determined by Kelley Taylor, the director of the office of affirmative action and equal employment opportunity, in consultation with Emmett Winn, associate provost of faculty affairs, “and/or the respective Dean, and/or Chair,” the policy states. 

In the Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy, corrective action is determined by the hearing officer instead.

If Hansen had sexually harassed the student on campus, she would have been given access to documents related to corrective action taken against him, per the Title IX policy. Since she was harassed off campus, however, the University has no obligation to share corrective action taken under the Policy Against Harassment and Discrimination.

Winn declined to comment for this story.

Jim Ward, counsel for the Alabama State Board of Pharmacy, said ""the Board is aware of the situation involving the Dean and is looking into the matter.""

When The Plainsman reached out to Hansen regarding the details of his suspension, he informed The Plainsman that he was, in fact, not being suspended…”

This Christmas I was lucky enough to score 3 Xbox Series X. It was legitimate (no bots) and honestly just awesome timing. I worked for a year to finally get one, and one day I somehow got 3, which was 1 more than I needed. Instead of selling it, I wanted to give it away to a family in need. I know these were impossible to get a a lot of families were hurting because of COVID.   


I contacted the local schools and let messages for weeks. They refused to get back with me. I'd state my name, that I was an Auburn resident, and that I just wanted to give it away, no strings attached. I said I'd gladly drop it off at the office, or anywhere and that I didn't even have to meet the student or know their name. Silence. Never got a phone call back...   


That's the Auburn school system, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I didn't grow up here; I grew up in a very small country town in norther NY where the average FAMILY income was less than $20,000 a year.. so maybe Auburn families can scoff at at a $550 gaming console, but most of us were too poor to afford gaming systems, and being well off now, as an adult, I just wanted to give back. Ended up flying home and giving it to a family there, so someone still got a good Christmas, but I am still aghast at the lack of correspondence and professionalism from the school system in the local area.

tbge3v,Anyone looking to rent a space? I'm looking to sublease my apartment,"It is a 3br. The 2 roommates are really cool, chill and we tend to keep to ourselves but still do roommate activities every once in a while. Rent is $482. There is a $25 insurance fee which will automatically get added if you don't have your own insurance. I graduate in may and i won't be around june and july. I will be leaving not too long after i graduate in may and i have a job offer outside of auburn, and so i would like to avoid paying rent for a space i won't be living in.

tgr0lj,"Diabetes Fundraiser Walk: Sunday April 10, 2022 Kiesel Park @2PM","This Spring, the Student Dietetic Association has partnered with the Diabetes and Nutrition Center of EAMC to host our first-ever Diabetes Walk! The Diabetes Walk serves as a fundraising event to aid local children with diabetes in access to continuous glucose monitors, as the price of these monitors per child is $150 per month, or $1800 per year. These wearable monitors will greatly improve the comfort and quality of life for the children who receive them, allowing them to have a more normal childhood without the constant focus and pricks to check on their blood glucose levels. The Diabetes Walk will take place on Sunday, April 10th at 2pm out at Kiesel Park where there will be the option for walkers to participate in either a one-mile or 5K walking trail. 
 
If you are interested in participating in the walk, register using the link below ($15 for students). If for any reason you are unable to attend the walk, but would still like to contribute to our cause there is also the option to donate!

However, they have said that classes have never felt crowded at all.

tslwrn,r/place is coming back and we need your support to immortalize a blue and orange AU.,"r/place was a social experiment run by Reddit on April 1st, 2017 where users could individually alter 1 pixel out of a million every 10 minutes or so. Together a blank canvas would inspire social collaboration and excitement as factions broke out and the landscape rapidly changed. After 72 hours the world was archived forever in its current state. Notorious factions such as the blue corner, rainbow road, 4chan's ""the void"" (which was defeated by the American Flag at one point) were all memorable aspects of this masterpiece.  


Every year Reddit has released a new experiment on April 1st to see how individuals can collaborate as a team with a common cause. This inevitably inspired a movement of ""place was better"".   


From April 1st, 2022 - April 4th, 2022 r/place will return and allow users to once again modify a pixel. Together we can band together and create a blue and gold AU!

u1h3ne,Is auburn right for me?,"I want to drop out. I am a month away from finishing my last semester of sophomore year at Auburn University. I need some REAL advice. When I talk to my parents they tell me to continue because a degree is needed to make big money and that 2 more years is gonna fly by. But I’m a business major. My passion isn’t to work for someone else, making someone else Rich. I want to 1st be a real estate agent to gain income to start my own business. I don’t need a degree to do that. Anyways here’s my reasons on why I want to drop out: 

Yes Auburn is a GREAT school. There’s no doubt about it. I am a first generation student so I have to pay for everything myself and I can’t afford doing things a normal student at Auburn does. Like be in a sorority. I still have the high school friends I came here with, and I haven’t really made any friends from campus. So my excitement for making new friends is actually non existent now bc I realize that I don’t have the same opportunity as others to do so. I can’t afford to go out everyday like all the other people do. I’m not interested in partying as much as I did freshman year. I’m interested in ACTUALLY STARTING MY LIFE. I feel like college is holding me back because I’m in classes that have no meaning to what I want to pursue. 

Here’s my reasons why I want to quit and start my own journey:

1. My pell grant got taken away bc my parents make a little more money than last year
This is Bull shit. I’m an independent student that works almost 30 hours a week to afford to pay rent and afford to pay for classes. College was almost free these past two years since I’m not in debt right now. But if I continued to stay in school I will be in student debt bc my financial aide doesnt cover everything anymore. 

2. My GPA is falling bc I have to sacrifice study time to work to make money. I have to keep a 3.0 GPA to keep my scholarships and it’s very stressful to keep the grades I need when I have to dedicate time to work instead of studying.

3. All my business classes I’ve taken so far is preparing me for applying to company’s, land an internship, have the perfect resume, and NOTHING about entrepreneurship. 

4. I can get my real estate license and start my career now instead of waiting 

5. I can start my drop shipping business now if I had the time 

6. I don’t have time for anything other than school and work and it’s ruining my mental health

My family is so excited for me graduating bc I’m the first in my family to do so. They think a degree is my golden ticket to success. I’m tired of this way of thinking. I’m a business woman and I know it. I want to start my own journey NOW. 

Any advice for me? Is college really worth all the debt I will get? Or should I stop now while I’m debt free and start working on myself and my dreams? I need help because I’m so lost",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/u1h3ne/is_auburn_right_for_me/,redpuppydawg,1,2022-04-11 16:44:20,0,/r/auburn/comments/u1h3ne/is_auburn_right_for_me/

u2c3xp,I made an AU Marketplace/Housing/Ride-sharing app 💚🐫,"💚🐫Hi everyone,

I have been working on this app for a while now and I am really excited to share it with you. It's a college marketplace restricted to students. You can buy, or sell anything you want to other students, ranging from dorm supplies, textbooks, apparel, and ride-sharing, to subleasing or finding off-campus housing for next year ... The app is free, a lot of hard work went into it so make sure you check it out if you need anything for the upcoming semesters! You can only log in using your auburn.edu school email! I think this app would help a lot of folks out there as long as it's used, cause man it's a pain to find housing or sell something on campus!

u7hm6q,Available sublease at The Collective,"I am looking for someone to sublease my apartment at The Collective. My lease is for a four bedroom house. Each house is a standalone unit.

There's also a pretty nice clubhouse with ping pong, billiards, printers, and study room.

u88dlt,The Desegregation at Auburn historic marker belongs in the front of the library.,"Someone asked over on r/Alabama what historic marker would you update, and it got me thinking.

The Desegregation at Auburn historic marker is out in the middle of the grass to the side of a walkway north of the library.

I remember when they put it in in 2015, and thinking, ""it's important for the university to acknowledge this part of its history.""

""Erected to commemorate 50 years of desegregation at Auburn University""

I wasn't at the dedication, I read about it later. Dr. Harold Franklin, the first black student at Auburn, was there for the ceremony. Dr. Franklin thanked the university for recognizing the contribution he made to desegregation. Also present was the president of the Harold A. Franklin Society. 

He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Auburn in 2001, defended his thesis in 2020, and was finally awarded his diploma at the Fall 2020 commencement 56 years after he first registered for classes.

The sign is necessary, it's important to document this. As I've thought about the sign more and more over the years, though, it just feels more like some kind of joke. The sign just makes me angry, now.

The marker is written passively: acting on a court order, President Draughon accepts Harold Franklin's application, Draughon schedules the registration for a Saturday and closes the campus to the public, and the university and the FBI provide him protection to register. It sounds like the university was really helpful, doesn't it? President Draughon sure was swell, wasn't he?

The marker doesn't mention that Auburn rejected him twice, did everything it could to keep rejecting him until the courts forced their hand, and that President Draughon collaborated with state law enforcement to surveil black applicants to dig up reasons to deny their applications. Nor that Franklin eventually withdrew because he believed this history faculty would never let him graduate.

I don't know anything about who wrote it. For all I know, Franklin wrote it himself and picked the spot, and just wanted to bury the hatchet with the university or something. Maybe they made him walk in the side door and that's where the event actually took place.

But I don't believe that. It feels like it was written by someone afraid of offending the university, or maybe the reader. And then it was tucked away in a corner of campus away from where someone might accidentally see it.

And guess who's name is still on the library? The building that, quite literally, casts a shadow over the marker every day?

Ralph Brown Draughon

Sometimes reality is more ridiculous than fiction.

I'd rewrite the sign. Then I'd move it so it's right in front of the library where every single visitor and tour group is forced to see it. I'd put it where you have to step around it to walk up the front steps.

We can do better. The marker for George Wallace's schoolhouse stand is at the front door of Foster Hall. I've seen it.

Instead of hiding it in the shadows, bring it into the sun.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/u88dlt/the_desegregation_at_auburn_historic_marker/,NotFranzKafka,1,2022-04-20 18:31:59,0,/r/auburn/comments/u88dlt/the_desegregation_at_auburn_historic_marker/

Alright, I might just be tripping, but here we go.

Believe it or not, I was googling it to show my friend that people get caught cheating for doing that relatively easy, and he should be more cautious. However, about 20 minutes ago, I took a SUPER easy, open notes, ProctorU final, but my dumbass didn't clear my history. So when my proctor was typing in the test URL, she saw my last five recent searches, AND THEY HAVE THE SCREEN RECORDING OF IT.

It takes 45 minutes for a buzz cut. How? I literally watched this girl talk with her client for 25 minutes about food, never touching his hair while 5 people waited in the lobby.. took all I could not to ask her what she’s doing. It’s rude and disrespectful to peoples’ time. 

If you’re looking to waste your time, come hang out here. You’ll spend more time waiting or taking with the ladies than getting your hair cut.. 

Find somewhere else to go. Used to be a great place when appointments were in place, but ever since management did away with appointments it’s futile.

upsar6,Blind x Quora X Ratemyprofessors for internships,"Hello everyone,

I am a recent grad from The University of Texas at El Paso and I was able to get an internship thanks to the students from reddit who helped me out. Being from a non-target school, it was a little harder to learn and get into internships however, it was possible for me because  random people on the internet decided to help me out.

With that being said, some other recent grads and I decided to make a website where students could directly help each other level up their professional careers. You can find internship reviews, instructional guides, and student success stories, and ask questions.

 If you want to share anything you've learned in your internships or anything that has helped you develop professionally, you can help students across the nation and get a little something for it. The internship reviews only take like 3 min, are super easy to do, and if you complete it all we'll send you $10.

We are also open to suggestions and all types of feedback. Thanks, everyone!

Are you throwing a party and want to cover everybody’s music taste?

Do this with [catalist.fm](http://catalist.fm/)

It’s a pretty simple concept: create a shared playlist in catalist.fm, get a QR code back. Print or share that QR code wherever (online, flyers, etc.)

People scan the QR code and add songs to your playlist. As the creator, you can configure some settings around the type of music to add to the playlist (only happy songs, no long songs etc.).

Then listen to the playlist at your next party!

We’ve used it with some success, and hoping others will find it useful too.

The website etc. all is free, you'll probably just need a premium Spotify account. Just you, the guests don't need one.

She's absolutely adorable - half golden, half lab, the softest silkiest fur in the world.

Her only real behavior issues are that she's a little mouthy still and she tends to bark sometimes.

I love her so much and I fully intended on putting everything I had into raising her, but due to health issues within my family and the aforementioned issues with her not meshing with our energy levels I think it's unfair to keep her in an environment where she gets bored and overactive.

I can include her kennel as well as a full container of food and all of her favorite toys and other things. Asking $40 just to ensure she goes to a good home, please tell me a little about yourself and your situation if you're interested. Thank you.

w65xua,Thanks for everything auburn.,"So to put some background on this, I am a Florida native. 

I’ve spent 5 out of the last 7 years living in auburn. I Got my bachelors degree from AU and now I’m about to move to Tallahassee to go to FSU for grad school so it’s a good opportunity for me to move back to my home state. 

Auburn is a great place, full of southern hospitality and I’ll definitely miss going to football games on Saturday in the fall even when the team lets me down haha. I’ll miss rolling toomers when we win and I’ll miss all the great people I met there. I’ll also miss eating at places like foos and little Italy haha. 

Anyways thanks for everything auburn, I will definitely be back and of course I’ll always be an auburn fan.

Well after the last two semester its finally coming together and will open fall 2022! 

The gameroom is where I made most of gaming friends, its a great place to hangout and meet people. There will be couch co-op / multiplayer and also PC's and console stations where you can play either online or over LAN with the other people in the gameroom. We also play card games at the two large tables across the walkway from the gameroom (they used to be in front and we told Taylor they need to stay close cause we use them so much). 

There is also an esports area where Auburn University esports teams will play in competitions, with a streaming booth in the corner for the shoutcasters. There was a misconception going around that the gameroom was being repurposed into the esports lounge, and it was only for esports. This is 100% false! The esports area are the 10 PCs within a glass area that those competing in esport competitions will play, so that they aren't disturbed or interupted. 

To use the desktops/consoles you will need to log into the computer just like you were using any Auburn university computer lab computer, using the first bit of your email and your password. For the couch multiplayer area you simply walk up and play. The controllers should be connected to the wall with long cables. This is a major improvement for the gameroom because before the staff would leave around 7 and you could no longer play on the consoles. Now the gameroom will be open from 7 am to 11:59 pm. 

Auburn University has hired a company to maintain the equipment, if a controller or console breaks, we will have a number on the wall to call and supposedly within an hour the company will come and replace the broken equipment. Also try not to spend all day on the computer at once. Taylor said they may put in two hour session limits on the PC's so make sure to share and log out everytime you go get snacks. 

If you don't know where the gameroom used to be/ is at, it is in the Melton student center, under chick fil a and outside of au bon pain. It is on the bottom floor on the side of the student center opposite Haley, facing the green space. 

I'd like to mention this is not an advertisement but simply an announcement that the Auburn University campus gameroom is reopening this fall. It is owned by Auburn University and is located on campus in the student center. 

TL,DR: Auburn University has brought back the campus gameroom, which is opening in the fall. It is in the bottom floor of the student center and is open to all Auburn Students.",https://www.reddit.com/r/auburn/comments/wcqj98/auburn_gameroom_reopening/,ja-kosa-kat,1,2022-07-31 10:52:43,0,/r/auburn/comments/wcqj98/auburn_gameroom_reopening/

My previous gf was 22, so I’m not opposed to dating younger women, provided they aren’t horribly immature. How do people not enrolled at he university meet other singles?

For example, when Penn State plays Maryland, I’d probably make crab cakes or a plate of crabby fries with plenty of Old Bay. We played Ohio on Saturday, and since they are from the city of Athens, I went Greek and made gyros. I think you can see the patterns here.

I’ve never really thought about what true “Alabama” food is… was thinking about making an étouffée for the game Saturday but my lady thinks that’s way more Louisiana/Cajun. Can’t say I disagree - I do love me some étouffée over rice though.

So help me out, how can I pay tribute to our good friends from Auburn this weekend in the kitchen?

Multiple officers and a SWAT team were outside the suspect’s house on Windway Drive, where police say the suspect barricaded himself inside, armed with a gun, with his three children, one being an infant.

According to Auburn officials, they deployed a SWAT team and negotiator to contact the subject.",https://bustednewspaper.com/alabama/randy-travis-navarre/20221011/,TomTheTerrific,1,2022-10-12 13:15:33,0,/r/auburn/comments/y29oas/owner_of_travs_performance_exhaust_on_opelika_road/

y4sag3,Registering for a class next Spring if I'm taking the prerequisite at SUSCC this Fall.," This semester I'm taking a class that is a prerequisite for a class I intend to take at Auburn next Spring. However, since Auburn's system won't be aware that I took and passed this class until I transfer the credits, I am wondering if it will allow me to register for this class once the registration window opens in a few weeks (traditionally, if you haven't passed or aren't taking the prerequisite at the time you're trying to register, it won't allow you to register for a particular class). 

My worry is that if I wait until mid-December there will be no spots left. 

I was wondering if anyone has been in this position before.

y7tilc,Advice or experience terminating a lease (The Collective),"Hey everyone, 

This semester I had planned to stay home and enroll fully online. However, once the semester started I had to change course and ended up coming back to campus. I didn't have housing so I signed with The Collective (formerly Aspen Heights) going by the pictures on their website. When I got there my unit was a massive disappointment. The furniture, in particular, is beyond the pale and quite simply it's pretty obvious they misrepresented the product/service they agreed to provide. There is no question about it. 

I wanted to ask if someone has been through something similar and if that's the case, if they have taken legal action. And if so, if there is a specific firm or attorney in the area you might recommend.
