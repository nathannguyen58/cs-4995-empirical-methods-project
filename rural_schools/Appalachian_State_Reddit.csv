bknop4,Sustainable technology major,I will be a junior this coming fall and I am currently a Bio major that is thinking of switching majors to sustainable technology. Is there anyone that can tell me if they enjoy the classes for this major or have anything to say about it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/bknop4/sustainable_technology_major/,zlotti,2,2019-05-04 13:43:46,2,/r/appstate/comments/bknop4/sustainable_technology_major/
bkybzt,Looking for a roommate for the next rent cycle (August 2019 - August 2020),"Hey guys,

I'm posting on here instead of App State Classifieds on Facebook because I no longer have a Facebook account.

My fiancee and I (both of us are 24 y.o.) are looking for someone who needs a place for the next school year. We haven't exactly nailed down the exact place we're going to rent from yet, but all of the properties we're looking to rent are between $900-$1300. Obviously since we're a couple; we'll pay a greater share of utilities and possibly rent, depending on the circumstances. So expect your portion of rent to be anywhere from $400 - $600 a month.

We do have a dog, she's a 7 year old collie mix and she's very sweet to people. Also she's very well house trained so there won't be any issues with ""accidents"" in the house. She also gets along very well with other cats and dogs alike.

We're looking for someone who doesn't party hard every weekend and doesn't smoke weed every waking moment of their lives. We're not homebodies by any means, but we are going back to Boone to finish our degrees so school and work will take precedent over everything else. 

We're generally pretty quiet and keep our place pretty clean. If anyone sounds interested please shoot me a DM. 

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/bkybzt/looking_for_a_roommate_for_the_next_rent_cycle/,gigalongdong,8,2019-05-05 10:30:34,0,/r/appstate/comments/bkybzt/looking_for_a_roommate_for_the_next_rent_cycle/

bnp5pw,Important question for advertising majors,"Have any other advertising majors had a hard time getting into COM2700 Foundations of Advertising? My advisor is the professor for the class so I thought I could get a straightforward answer about how to get into this class but he’s been pretty unhelpful. Every time I asked he told me about the two summer sessions, the first being on campus, and the second online and then the two sessions in the fall. The problem being that the online and fall sessions are completely filled as well as their waitlist and I would have a very hard time trying to take the class on campus as I need to work to pay my rent for next year. Does anybody have any suggestions about how to handle this situation and/or know where I could take it at another university over the summer that would transfer? Also why are there so few sections for  a course that’s required for a major? They evidently only offered one section this past spring semester.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/bnp5pw/important_question_for_advertising_majors/,greatandwisepandabea,5,2019-05-12 09:51:14,5,/r/appstate/comments/bnp5pw/important_question_for_advertising_majors/

bsl91u,Best games to go to?,"Hey guys, 27m here huge sports fan in Southern California. The sports culture, especially college out here is garbage. I grew up going to all the USC/UCLA (Go Bruins) games but those werent always the best atmospheres. Ive always wanted to live in the south (for a few reasons including college football) for half a year or so and am moving there (either Nashville, Greenville SC, or Birmingham. still deciding where) this August until new years or so.

My plan is to go to the absolute BEST college football games this year every Saturday or so in the south. I will be driving. And it doesnt matter if I have to leave at midnight Friday and come back Sunday. My main sport is NFL (Go Broncos) and I havent followed college football at an intricate level so I want to know not only the best teams to to see live (obviously Bama, Clemson, UGA etc), but the best teams to see them play against. Im sure the atmospheres are completely different bases on if they are die hard rivals or not. Like when I see the Broncos play in Denver the games vs the Chiefs, Raiders, and Pats have such a better atmosphere than playing teams like the bengals, redskins, or rams.

So far I know that seeing the Iron bowl would be a must do (even though tickets are around $300 right now), and LSU at night (also how do you know which games are night games since the times aren't out yet)? Of course seeing UGA is big but what opponent games that they would play would have the best atmosphere? Some people mentioned seeing the Sandman atmosphere at VT too.

Some of the options ive read: Bama, clemson, auburn, tennessee, LSU, Gainsville, UGA, South Carolina, VT, Florida State, Ole Miss, Memphis, A&amp;m (but this is probably out because a bit too far to drive to for the weekend), Arkansas, Arkansas State, Miss state. Any more?

So far ive narrowed down some ones that could be good by date. Im not worried about skipping some weeks or going to just ""average games"" for the sake of my time or wallet.

Here is the 2019 schedule for reference

[http://www.espn.com/college-football/schedule](http://www.espn.com/college-football/schedule)

8/31: Not any huge games it looks like but do any openers have great atmospheres? Someone mentioned **Ole Miss at Memphis** will be a wild one. That Thursday is a night game **GT at Clemson**. Not sure how that will be.

9/7: **A&amp;M at Clemson?** Seems to be the best Clemson game all year.

9/14: **Bama at South Carolina?**

9/21: Coincidentally im probably going to the **Michigan at Wisconsin** game this weekend since ill be in Green Bay for the Broncos Packers game. and yes I know UGA is hosting Notre Dame but cant go to that

9/28: Not sure, any good ones? **Towson Tigers at Florida?** lol jk **Ole Miss at Bama?** Would probably be going to a bigger bama game later in the year but would go twice if its worth it. Someone mentioned **Cincinnati at Marshall and also maybe Clemson at UNC.**

10/5: **Auburn at Florida** at the swamp is a game everyone is recommending. But this could be my only good chance to see the Vols when its **UGA at Tenn.** So not sure.

10/12: Wedding this weekend no games. I know, California.

10/19: I heard about the 3rd Saturday of October when its **Vols at Bama.** But would probably be going to the better LSU at Bama later in the year so not sure if I should go twice. If I dont go it could be a good chance to go to the Grove. **A&amp;M at Ole Miss? LSU at Miss State?** Not sure which one of those would be better.

10/26: **Auburn at LSU** seems to be a lock. Want it to be a night game. Plus Saints play on that sunday.

\---10/31 Someone mentioned if I can go halloween night **GT at App State** would be fun.

11/2: **UGA at Florida?** The cocktail party seems like a blast even though im already going to a game in florida. I know this game is at a nuetral stadium. Someone also mentioned **Miami at Florida State?**

11/9: **LSU at Bama?** Seems like an good one.

11/16: **UGA at Auburn?** I heard that this game is not to be missed. But would already be going to the Auburn game vs Bama 2 weeks later. And if I dont do this one, I would be able to see **LSU at Ole miss** if that is a good one.

11/23: **A&amp;M at UGA?** Plus Falcons play on that sunday.

11/30: **Bama at Auburn?** The Iron bowl.

Im not sure if all this would be realistic but I want to see as many good games as I can.

Also Ill be probably going alone to these games. Any recs on how to kind of blend in/make friends via tailgating when at the game? Any best tailgate spots places to go?

My location in the south would be central so these should be a 8ish hour drive or closer. Also any recommendations on best cities to live in the south? Don't want something too touristy (still want that southern feel) but dont want a pure college atmosphere so that ill stand out if not going to the school. Thanks guys. Also 2 games in one day or weekend is possible im sure but would probably need to wait for the time of the games to be announced.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/bsl91u/best_games_to_go_to/,moneyyman,11,2019-05-24 15:39:54,9,/r/appstate/comments/bsl91u/best_games_to_go_to/

cjslrt,HRT access for trans folks in Boone? (cross-posted from Boone subreddit),"I lived in Boone back in fall 2015 and miss it dearly. One of the main reasons I had to leave was that I had the hardest time getting ahold of testosterone (I'm transmasculine) despite already having the prescription. I was in grad school at App at the time and the health service there was unhelpful. I'd really like to move back in the next couple of years but if the situation hasn't changed much, I don't think I'd be able to make a life there.

Have any trans people at app been able to get reliable access to HRT in Boone or anywhere nearby? Are mail order prescriptions an option? Seems like Asheville is the closest option and a 4-hour round trip for a prescription ain't ideal. Any info anybody's got is appreciated.

Thanks!,https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/cxm5rh/applying_for_next_fall_advice/,slyxtherin,4,2019-08-30 16:06:33,1,/r/appstate/comments/cxm5rh/applying_for_next_fall_advice/
cxx4li,"1 bedrooms near campus, preferably West King Street.","I know this is a long shot but I'm trying to find all my options here. I currently live in 494 Lofts, which is extremely close to campus and right on W king. However it's extremely small and I have to maneuver around this efficiency unit with my big ass service dog. It's just really small for the two of us. 350 square feet with me and a golden retriever, it's a bonding experience for sure. 

I'm either trying to get a 1 bedroom within this same building (for either next semester or next year so if you know/are someone who needs to transfer a lease tell me pls), or finding something else on King Street that's 1 bedroom. So if you know any buildings around me I would love to know their names so I can look 'em up.

duthz1,Moving Conferences,"One if the greatest transitions into the FBS has came from our Mountaineers and beating South Carolina from the SEC only adds to that. We have all of the reason in the world to be considered moving conferences if you just purely look at our football team, but unfortunately that’s not what these conferences only consider. 

The second most important sport they look into is basketball. There was great student turnout in the first game against Ferrum but the ACC would never consider us if we only have our attendance around 1000 and the AAC would only consider adding schools that have great football complementary with a good basketball team. So let’s support this new era of Men’s Basketball coached by Dustin Kerns and pack the Holmes Center every game. 

There are many other factors in moving conferences but as fans this is what we can do to make a difference. It would help recruiting for basketball, as well as it could be a recruiting chip for football if we start winning often. For example our basketball team had its best year in recruiting this past year and part of that is on the new coach but a lot of that is on the success onset by our football team. So let’s set the standard of Men’s basketball and make Holmes Center an electric place for this year and years to come.

eavngp,NCSU vs App,"This might seem like a dumb question, but I’ll ask anyways

I was accepted to App, and I’m waiting to hear back from State 

I live near the coast, about an hour from Raleigh

I’m 5 hours away from Boone 

State is obviously a lot closer. However, I originally applied to App State as my safety. I did a bit of research on the area and decided to apply. I didn’t have any major interest in it 

But, after receiving my acceptance and doing more research, I find that I am drawn to the area. The campus is beautiful (hoping to tour it soon), and the atmosphere of the mountains is very appealing to me. 

I am majoring in computer science and have been told that State is supposedly the “best” in the state for it. My dad really likes the school, and I do as well. But there’s just something about App that is really calling to me. I think it’s just the rural area. I like nature and the mountains more than a city like Raleigh. 

Can anyone elaborate on how the program at state is different than the one at App? And how different is the overall atmosphere.

This summer, we have plans to create our first short film, Claire. In the film, Claire has recently gotten sober after her child has been aborted and her boyfriend has gone missing.

It's a very dark short film that we have been writing for some time. Seeing as we are a young duo and are both still in college, we can't pay very much money, but we most certainly would like to create something memorable and great. For anyone who is remotely interested in acting, it would certainly be a great resume opportunity. We plan to enter the film into as many local Film Festivals as possible, so you would most definitely be seen and appreciated by a large number of people. 

If you have any kind of interest whatsoever and will be available in the summer, please, don't hesitate to send either of us an email:

I’ve been accepted to a grad program at App that will begin in the Fall. The courses take place in the evening, and I realized that I really don’t need to live that close to campus since I’ll only be attending class 2-3 nights a week, unlike undergrad.

I’m wondering if y’all know of anyone who’s lived far from Boone (like 2hrs) who has been successful in graduate studies at ASU. I would have the option of staying with family just down the mountain some days, so it would definitely be possible, but not sure if it’s the best idea because of the long commute. 

I was originally going to attend UNCC since I can live with family and avoid housing costs, but I really think I like App’s program more. Since the costs would even out, attending the program that’s a better fit makes sense to me, but I would greatly appreciate insight if y’all have any to offer.

For starters, I identify as a gay man and I was wondering how the scene at ASU is. I am coming from a very homophobic small town, so is ASU pretty good for someone that is gay and not necessarily interested in sleeping around? (I am honestly pretty tired of only seeing people into that.)

My second question deals with how I am coming from an early college. What is the average time it would take someone to finish their bachelor's at ASU when coming from an early college?

And finally, where would be the best place to make friends before coming to ASU? I currently have no friends from my school going there and I would appreciate a few faces to recognize when I go there.

(Kinda irrelevant to me going there, but by chance, is there any sort of competitive League of Legends team? I have been brushing off practicing for a while, but I am starting to get back into it.)

Anyways, I am glad to be going to ASU now, but I am still extremely nervous having to be so far from home with no guidance now.

fm1vja,[COVID-19 update] In-person commencement ceremony cancelled; will proceed virtually,"**Message from Chancellor Sheri Everts** 

First, my sincere thanks to each of you who has stepped up these past few weeks as we adjust to rapidly developing, unprecedented challenges. Faculty and staff are working long hours to transition to alternative course delivery for our students. We are keenly focused always on the health and safety of our campus community and the fulfillment of our academic mission.

For many of us, the “Appalachian Experience” is firmly grounded in a sense of place. We are all saddened by our empty classrooms and sunny days with no hammocks and slacklines, and while we are fortunate to have technology to keep us connected, Zoom meetings and Panopto just aren’t the same.

Typically at this time of year, we are well into planning May Commencement ceremonies. President Roper [announced at today’s Board of Governors meeting](https://www.northcarolina.edu/sites/default/files/presidents_report_march_20_2020.pdf) that Spring graduation ceremonies will be disrupted, and campuses can make independent decisions about how to move forward with Commencement ceremonies. **For Appalachian, this will mean a virtual Commencement in May.**

There are many details to work out, but please know my leadership team and I are committed to preserving, to the greatest extent possible, the essence of the celebrations and milestones of the final weeks of the Spring semester, including Commencement. We don’t know exactly what that will look like, but we are working hard on virtual solutions.

On Monday, Appalachian will begin a new normal. What does “the university remains open” look like for us as we face increased prevalence of the coronavirus and the uncertainties that come with it?

Here’s what it will look like on Monday: 

* 160 students who [met the criteria to stay on campus](https://housing.appstate.edu/) will remain in their residence halls. Many others picked up essentials - or more - this week and returned to their homes. The residence halls have been thoroughly cleaned, and only residents are allowed in the buildings.
* Reduced staffing for facilities means we are all operating under limited capacities. Our academic classroom and office buildings, Student Union, and University Libraries are keeping their core services available, but some buildings will be key- or card-access only.
* Dining facilities are on a [reduced schedule, and takeout only](https://dining.appstate.edu/dining-menus/operating-schedules/extended-spring-break-operating-schedule).
* Faculty and students, who are accustomed to face-to-face interaction, will be teaching and learning online. It has taken tremendous effort on the part of our faculty to make this move and they have proven yet again to be selfless and adaptive professionals. It will not be a seamless transition, and as we work out the kinks together, it will be important to be patient and recognize we are all working alongside one another to provide the best possible academic experience for our students.

Many of us have loved ones who are attending other UNC System institutions. We find ourselves comparing methods and messages. Your university administrators are in regular contact with their counterparts across the system and in the System Office. We are following System guidance together and applying it to our campuses in the ways that make the most sense for each of our situations.

We will continue to send you emails with key updates and changes. These will also be posted to the university’s dedicated [coronavirus website](https://www.appstate.edu/go/coronavirus/), which also links to information from key areas across campus that are making operational adjustments.

Our Mountaineer resiliency is being tested. We will continue to rise to these challenges. Your resourcefulness, ingenuity and hope bolster the entire Appalachian Community as we find our way, and I am encouraged by your determination and creativity.

Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/fm1vja/covid19_update_inperson_commencement_ceremony/,professionalpaprika,1,2020-03-20 16:14:13,2,/r/appstate/comments/fm1vja/covid19_update_inperson_commencement_ceremony/

We are academic researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and would like to invite you to **participate in our research study in return for scientifically valid personality feedback.** Your participation will directly contribute to a doctoral student’s Ph.D. dissertation.

In the last few decades, psychologists have rigorously developed empirical tests that assess the core aspects of personality**. You will receive scientifically valid feedback about your personality after taking this short survey (less than 5 minutes).** The feedback will be customized to your responses using the scores of thousands of people who have participated so far.

The test is non-commercial, entirely free, and as anonymous as possible. And, you will have our gratitude—this research is not possible without the help of people like you!

g619xf,Is there a parking problem at App State?,"Hello guys! Since the last year, I’ve been working on a project to address the parking problem at universities. I’ve developed a business model that provides a solution to the problems I identified at FAU, the university I went for my bachelors. Later, I realized from talking to students from other Universities, that the problems are present in most of the largest Universities in the USA. Below is what we heard the most from other students:

&gt;Every semester students face the same problem; having to arrive at school 45 minutes to one hour earlier just to be able to have time to find a parking spot. It is a real hassle being able to find a parking spot and it becomes frustrating and stressful. 

A group of friends and I decided to continue with the idea and er committed to solving the problem by designing a solution to help students and faculty to find parking much faster. So, to help us better build a solution for the students and the schools, we are asking students at various Universities a few questions about their experience when parking at your university campus. We would appreciate your help with this! We are on the way to developing something GREAT for the infrastructure, not only for one university but for all other universities in the United States.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.

It is a Google Forms format, and it will only take you **1 minute!**

$650/month + utilities which are about $100 a month.

hreo1i,In person classes discussion,"Online classes are so much harder to enjoy, prioritize and get work done in. In person classes we can have conversations, use body language and meet up in a place dedicated for learning. I am a philosohy major and communication and discussion are key to having a good class. Most of my online classes were one way video conversations and silent discussion threads typing away on my keyboard. In person classes are also ways to meet new people and make new friends.

 So many people agree how bad motivation for online classes are. I want to enjoy and be engaged in learning because that is what I am paying thousands of dollars for. We can all wear masks and wash our hands and we will be ok. If there are people at risk we can make exceptions for them but the majority of our students and faculty are healthy and will be ok even if exposed to the virus. If you are not feeling good then you should stay home and the teachers can accommodate you until you return to class once you are better. 

There are also on campus recourses like the library and bookstore for students. As well as food and extra curricular activities like clubs and playing outside or catching pokemon together. 

In person classes are too important if we want our students to get the most out of the college experience.

httpsq,A brief message from Chancellor Everts.,"For those of you who've been (reasonably) ignoring the banal walls of text in your App State inbox, I'd like to submit the following: 

&gt; As we all work to respond to the latest impacts  of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UNC Board of                         Governors has asked all UNC institutions to conduct financial scenario planning exercises.                         These scenarios are based on potential drops in enrollment; reductions in state appropriations;  the loss of business, athletics, and auxiliary  revenue, and unanticipated expenses. We are not                         alone in assessing the possible financial implications of the pandemic, but certainly                         recognize that should we encounter sizable  budget cuts, we could face unprecedented changes                         to our university. While it is important to recognize these are planning exercises, I want                         to be clear that my leadership team and I meet   regularly with the Faculty Senate Executive                         Team, and we will continue working   collaboratively with Faculty Senate, Staff  Senate and our Student Government Association to ensure they are engaged should we need to enact any of the possible financial scenarios. 

Oh, good. You're prepared for *a loss of revenue.* Are you prepare for students with no dining hall? How are we dealing with people being housed four to a dorm room? What's the acceptable level of student mortality before all go home? And what happens when older instructors cheese it because your response to a pandemic is to cancel a student break and 86 some bus stops? 

I appreciate your commitment to the university's financial health, but I've been reading these in hope of some viable plan and haven't seen a damn thing. And if there's some robust secret strategy, the instructors don't seem to be clued in, either. 

If this all goes south, perhaps we lobby for a replacement - one wise enough to blow off the accountants and talk to an epidemiologist instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/httpsq/a_brief_message_from_chancellor_everts/,StopBoofingMammals,73,2020-07-18 23:16:13,84,/r/appstate/comments/httpsq/a_brief_message_from_chancellor_everts/

hxb0ka,App State vs UNCA,"Hi everyone. So I’m transferring from UNCA this fall and I’m kinda nervous tbh. UNCA was small, the professors were nice and listened to individual questions, the halls had suite style bathrooms (no more than 4 people shared one), and everything just felt good and I guess I got comfortable. 

So if you transferred from UNCA to App last year or last semester. What do you think? Do you think it’s better? Was it a comfortable transition? Do you regret it?

I know that some people would say no duh but Idk I’m thinking that the small size would have been better given the current situation with the virus andwhatnot. I’ve also watched a few YouTube videos where someone said that there’s literally nothing in Boone, like I shouldn’t expect it to have all the shops and places that Asheville has. Also said everything is expensive and another person said that the dorms and the shared bathrooms weren’t good. Plus the weather is too extreme at App I heard. 

In the end if App turns out to be better than UNCA, cool but even if it is worse than UNCA I won’t be going back bc of better financial aid, job and networking opportunities at App but I’m just getting nervous about going there esp. at a time like this. So if you transferred from UNCA to App just let me know how it went for you so I can hopefully calm down and stop being so nervous.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/hxb0ka/app_state_vs_unca/,wannabeasspiggy,1,2020-07-24 18:02:23,11,/r/appstate/comments/hxb0ka/app_state_vs_unca/

I don’t know anyone that is attending app and getting to know friends would be hard from the virus.

My main point is I’m attending college for the studies but also for the fun and I don’t feel like I’m going to have much of anything fun this upcoming semester because of this situation. So is it worth it spending the money on housing when I wouldn’t need to?

Repeatedly tried to contact winkler, and they were their usual dodgy self; the lady initially was sympathetic and offered a payment plan when I couldn't pay up, then went ghost, then emailed me back demanding money. I received one call from them on move out and missed it, tried calling back to no answer.

My question is, what are the real penalties/risks if I just say F em and stop contact/ not pay the last three months of rent?

id2gsp,Chances of Getting In? (IN-STATE) (pls answer),"Hi, I’m currently a senior at an early college. I’m going to be graduating with both a high-school diploma and an Associates Degree in Arts (around 60+ credits). I’m trying to evaluate all my options given that I can be a little indecisive about big things like a career.

I’m curious what chances I have on getting into App State to study communication disorders and then do my masters in speech language pathology.

Demographics: Hispanic Female

First generation college student

Class Rank 14 out of 79

SAT:1170 ACT:23 (I’m also debating whether or not I should omit my scores since it’s test optional this year)

GPA Unweighted: 3.9429

GPA Weighted: 4.6429

I have 200+ hours total in tutoring, volunteering at various events, church group studies for children, and helping provide personalized face masks w/a small business. 


Any predictions about my chances as an applicant for Fall 2021? Any suggestion specifically regarding whether I should submit my test scores? I would accept any feedback with gratitude!

We need a space with a pretty large table where we can enjoy our game and not break social distancing rules in the process.

irhnks,[Academic] Survey on College Students Perceptions of Individual Privacy and Trust in Digitized Contact Tracing (Undergraduate College Students Only),"This is IRB approved research.

Approved by moderators.

Dear prospective participant,

We would like you to participate in a research survey that is being led by Clemson University’s Analytics and Data Lab. Our survey gauges college students on their perceptions of individual privacy and privacy of location and space and how it relates to trust when adopting an institution led digitized contact tracing application.

* You need to be an undergraduate college student at a two-year or four-year college in the United States.
* This survey will take 10 to 15 minutes to take.
* At the end of the survey is a sign up for optional follow-up interviews that will be led by students of our Analytics and Data Lab.
* Your survey answers remain anonymous outside of the Analytics and Data Lab and will be used internally by us to create a big picture of college students’ point of view on individual location privacy when it comes to a digitized contact tracing application, something that is extremely important in today’s day and age considering the on-going COVID-19 epidemic.  

   * The only personal identifiable information being collected will be your gender, ethnicity, the college you are currently attending, current class standing, and major.

The survey will open September 1st, 2020, and close October 1st, 2020, or when we reach 200 participants.

Please let us know if you have any questions and again thank you so much.

iy3t80,Help Prospective Students Learn About Appalachian State!,"Good afternoon to ye, r/Appstate.  By the grace of your extremely generous moderators I have been given permission to ask you all for some help. I am an intern for a website called CollegeVizzy which has taken upon itself the task of creating a space wherein prospective students can both compile their own notes about universities that they are considering attending, and learn more about said universities from students currently in attendance there.  The site was originally developed for students without the means to visit schools in person (as a comprehensive addition to standard virtual visits, which we link to), but in the time of COVID, the necessity for this site has become more broad.  That brings me to where you guys can, if you are so inclined, join in.  

The content of this site is intended to be a majority of social-media style posts about anything and everything Appalachian State, in your case.  And with college visits being something of a rarity this semester, most of the posting at this early stage would most feasibly come from students currently on campus.  If you are at all interested in helping with this project, and undoubtedly helping some future mountaineers, the link to the site is below.  Everything is free, there are no ads, we sell no user data, and making a post will enter you into a giveaway that we’re running for a $150 Uber Eats gift card (we had to think of some incentive).

Tell us about anything: football, NC, things you like to do with your free time, your adventures into the woods near campus (do y’all do that?  The surrounding areas look so green an nice).  If you have any questions about the site or about posting, or any feedback, leave it down below.  I would be more than happy to talk to you guys.  

Thanks a lot and good luck this semester.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/iy3t80/help_prospective_students_learn_about_appalachian/,chumer_ranion,1,2020-09-23 00:52:32,0,/r/appstate/comments/iy3t80/help_prospective_students_learn_about_appalachian/

j6kxnv,An open discussion on CV,"This is a post to discuss covid at app. If there any statistics and studies you think should be shared, please post them. I will also adjust this to include other topics and corrections as this goes along.

Ever since Chad Dorrills death, it seems that people have been taking CV much more seriously. CV can cause permanent damage to the body. But the statistics as to how likely permanent damage occurs is unknown. And the death rate is under 3% (This is inaccurate, and is lower because the numbers are inflated). But what happened to Chad is not the rule, its the exception. Based on some rumors from a credible source, he is considered a CV death, but the cause is not directly CV. This implies he had a second medical condition that didnt pair well with CV. I also know he was cleared for CV and sent back to boone before he was hospitalized. So im unsure as to whether CV actually did have any role in his death (I think it did.) But this should not scare anyone anymore than what we already know about CV. I have heard and read that a lot more people have been getting tested for one reason or another since chad's death, but nothing has changed. This demonstrates that not only has the administration failed, but we all have as a society. The thing about the importance of CV is not about how much we test for it and know how many people have it. The numbers will always be out dated by some sizeable degree. it is that CV is more like the flu and less like the plague. The death rate and count is bogus. The numbers are extremely exaggerated, and the lockdown has done far more harm than good. All we can do is live our lives while minimizing our chance of exposure. When we begin to feel sick and believe it might be CV, act appropriately. Isolate and minimize exposure. But if what happened to Chad changes your attitude now, people in nursing homes have been dying since this started. It shouldn't take a fellow student dying to take this more seriously.

Being near someone with CV does not mean you are likely to get it. In most cases, keeping your hands away from your face and keeping them clean when eating is sufficient for the daily routine. What you should realise is that if you are near other people, some of their germs could get on your shirt from their breath, so if you wipe your hands on your shirt, and then grab your burger and eat it, maybe you  get CV. But that is how most viruses spread, it is through physical contact, and CV is no different. Groups of people should be less of a concern and your awareness of physical contact with the environment should be of greater concern, not to state that either arent important. Colleges are tight clusters of people, where they interact largely with the campus. Our administration should know this and shouldnt have sent us to school if they were truly concerned. But now that we are up here, we have to act appropriately. 

Rant: What is inappropriate is blaming the spread of CV solely on parties, or trump supporters, or the administration. We need to acknowledge that it is going to spread no matter what. Nothing will change that, and it may even stick around for a few years. If you are someone who is blaming Mrs. Everts for this CV disaster, stop. We need to get her replaced, but until we have the majority of our students back on campus, stop screaming her name. We should demand her resignation at some point, but now is not it. If you are someone who has listened to the far left and is blaming trump and/or the republicans for the state our nation, the lockdowns were more strongly enforced and supported by the democrats, while at the same time, they called for mass protest across the nation, So stop blaming trump/republicans. In reality, its both sides fault. And if you are someone who goes to a party during this pandemic, please be respectful to your community at all levels and isolate until you know you are fine. Lets stop with the finger pointing, and try to help everyone. 

What do you all think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/j6kxnv/an_open_discussion_on_cv/,BAXENATOR,1,2020-10-07 01:01:47,18,/r/appstate/comments/j6kxnv/an_open_discussion_on_cv/

Here's everything you need to know. Be a voter!","**From Thursday, Oct. 15th through Saturday, Oct. 31st you can vote at ANY early voting location in your county.**

**In NC, college students can register to vote at school OR home (your choice)**

* Info specific for college students: https://www.campusvoteproject.org/stateguides/North-Carolina

**You can register or change your registration at any early voting site in your county** 

* You will need to prove your residence with ID or a utility bill, paycheck, etc.  [Info is here](https://www.ncsbe.gov/registering/how-register/register-person-during-early-voting).  You *cannot* register or change your registration on election day.  

**Make a plan for when and where you're going to vote and put it on your calendar.**

* It is generally super convenient.  Some times and locations are more or less busy.  If you have the flexibility, avoid the first and last days and weekends.  Early in the day tends to be better.  If I find a wait time estimator I will add it here.  

**All races are important so make sure to vote the whole ballot!**

* Before you vote you can [check your sample ballot](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/) so you’re not surprised by anything when you get there.

* You can also hand deliver it to any [open early voting location in your county](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/ossite/).  Make sure you and your witness signed it and that your witness filled in their complete address!  You can also choose to vote early in person instead of handing in your ballot.  But don’t vote twice under any circumstances.  

**If you vote on election day, November 3rd**  

* Your polling place will be different. Find it here: https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/

* On Election Day all polling places are open from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.  Any voter in line at 7:30 p.m. will be able to vote. The busiest times tend to be early in the morning and just before the polls close. Avoid longer lines by voting at off-peak times.

**You do NOT need ID to vote in NC in 2020**

* If you present to vote and your name is not on the voter list for any reason, you have the right to cast a provisional ballot.

**You can vote from your car if you are at increased risk of Covid or are unable to enter the voting place without physical assistance due to age or disability**

* Read more about curbside voting here: https://www.ncsbe.gov/voting/help-voters-disabilities/curbside-voting  It is available at ALL early voting sites and all election day voting sites.

**PLEASE WEAR A MASK AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCE!**

I copy and pasted this from email so its a little long. I have included a tl;dr at the bottom.  


 My friend is a transfer from early college. Her classes were moved  online because of COVID and she had already moved up here so she could  get settled up here for when her classes start in the spring. She signed  a lease for an apartment off campus and is currently living there.  However the policy is that all incoming freshman (she is considered one  because she receives both here Associates and High school degrees at the  same time in December) must live in dorms. When I called they said  there were no exemptions to this however I wanted to expand upon it and  ask if there might be a case where she does nor have to live on campus.  Such as with specific permissions from her parents and/or being only a part time student, until policy allows her to be a full time student  living off campus. Would either of these be able to exempt her? She  cannot cancel the lease and it seems somewhat predatory to require to  pay rent for a lease and pay for a dorm when she can only live in one  place at a time. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Basically I want to know if my friend can get exempt from housing in any way.

jm4rzp,If Your Classes Use The Adobe Suite,"Hey y'all, so this might just be a me problem, but a few weeks ago I had a billion and a half issues with my laptop. There were a bunch of pop ups and ads and everything. It was really annoying, and it slowed down my laptop, caused Photoshop, Premiere, Audition, InDesign, and every other Adobe Suite application to crash to where the only way they would work was if I restarted my laptop every 20 minutes. 

I knew something was wrong, but I couldn't figure it out. Turns out, somehow I had installed something called ""Photopia"" (NOT Photopea, which is different), and it had been wrecking and causing issues. It disguised itself by saying it was a part of the Adobe Suite applications, so I thought nothing of it. Then I looked it up, and nothing shows up for it, except ""Did you mean Photopea?,"" which gave obvious suspicion. Then I dug a little deeper and found some reviews which were all rates 5/5 stars, but there were only like four people giving those reviews, so again, another red flag.

I tried to delete it and uninstall it from my files, but it was still there. Then I went to Google and it said it was still installed and literally said something along the lines of ""This application includes malware."" I uninstalled it immediately AGAIN, and so far haven't had any issues. 

I couldn't take my laptop in to get checked before because I've had project after project and I'm taking 18 credit hours this semester, and I felt like I would get behind in my classes if I had to wait to get it checked out and possibly have to pay a lot of money to get it fixed right now. Turns out I'm just an all around idiot and got behind in my classes anyway because it caused such a huge issue. I'm definitely going to get my laptop checked anyway now, like I should have done in the first place, but basically I wanted to say DON'T TRUST PHOTOPIA. Just don't. I'm sure you guys are smarter than me and won't/don't have this issue anyway, but there's a warning. 

I still don't understand how Photopia got installed into my laptop in the first place though, if it was a certain website I went to, or if I just mistakenly was like ""oh that app sounds cool"" and installed it. So just be on the watch, no one wants to have to deal with malware, especially when most -if not all- of your classes are online.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/jm4rzp/if_your_classes_use_the_adobe_suite/,quintsea,1,2020-11-01 11:10:40,7,/r/appstate/comments/jm4rzp/if_your_classes_use_the_adobe_suite/

jromar,The infamous Red Dot House,"Hello, 

App state alumni here with my first reddit post.

I am doing a story on Doctor Richard Stahl, the infamous App State professor charged and indicted with Life Insurance Fraud. His home, atop Howards knob, cut quite a figure in the town of Boone. The house was torn down for a few years back, but those that remember Professor Stahl's home, remember the ominous black house with a central red dot that overlooked the campus valley.

As a student (2015 graduate) I heard farfetched stories of orgy parties, satanic worshipping, and unhinged hedonism at the famed red dot house. After researching for my story/podcast, I have come to learn loads of stuff about Stahl's background and his subsequent indictment, but I have been unable to find first/second person accounts of the goings-on within red dot house. 

Does anyone within the reddit community have any in person experience with Dr. Stahl (was an education professor in early 1990s and 2000s) or any knowledge of red dot house before it was abandoned/destroyed. I would love to confirm if the house was truly used as Stahls pleasure pad or if it was simply a bizarrely designed home by a kooky professor. 

Any help/anecdotes would be immensely helpful!",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/jromar/the_infamous_red_dot_house/,gardnergn,1,2020-11-10 11:57:24,16,/r/appstate/comments/jromar/the_infamous_red_dot_house/

I realize this is required for probably every comp sci BS at every uni. However, I just feel that UNC has not accommodated me at all.

jvu2uq,Does anyone else think app/Boone is a bit overrated?,"So I’m a freshman at app and I have noticed a lot of changes. My sister graduated at app in 2013. I got to visit her a lot because I live only about 2 hrs away. Anyway, when she was there, there were almost half as many students as there are now. There wasn’t a shit ton of gentrification like there is now. And the traffic wasn’t nearly as bad as it is every fucking day. Also why does app claim diversity when, at most, I see maybe around 5 kids on campus that are poc. Another thing: I was going to app thinking I could get away from the shitty people in my hometown, and I kid you not, the specific people I wanted to be away from fucking go here now!!! Lastly, does anyone think everyone’s personality here are a bit similar?? I’m not focusing on the negative. Don’t get me wrong, Boone is fucking amazing and the place as so much to offer. But idk, the tourism, the gentrification, the shit load of people, the similar personalities make this a place a bit overwhelming and overrated in my opinion.

The one thing that's really kept me going is this seemingly impossible goal of just waiting it out. Just getting to Appalachian. This is happening now! It's real! It's tangible!!

Even before getting into App, it's had such a huge and amazing impact on my life. Cannon Music Camp there is where I found out I was trans. It was where I met some people I really love. It is probably the single greatest reason I'm coming to Appalachian, and I'm so glad I'm able to say that I'm going to be a part of that community. I know it's not going to be easy, and that COVID could just come in and mess everything up again, but I don't even care. Right now, this is what's keeping me going.

And for once, I'm so, so ready for the journey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/katanc/i_got_accepted/,pogspice,1,2020-12-10 21:06:52,14,/r/appstate/comments/katanc/i_got_accepted/
kato24,Looking for pandemic pals,"Hey this is probably a weird post but I figured some of ya'll might be going through similar stuff. Basically I'm looking to expand my circle, I have a good group of friends but most of them either went home for break or they're working a lot and I feel bad bugging them all the time. I lost my girlfriend in a car accident in October and I'm just now settling back into Boone full time so it's been kinda lonely. I had a job lined up, but that recently fell through so now I'm just sitting at home. Obviously there's a pandemic so I'm cool with just online gaming or videocalls or whatever but I haven't been going out much besides groceries. I have a dog, Tito, so we're always down for a dog walk. I have a switch and PS4 and am a pretty big Pokémon nerd. I have some board games but I really like Monopoly and Catan. I'm also working on my portfolio so I can apply for a tattoo apprenticeship so I'm always down to draw, actually if you're down to do art together plz hmu I'm so behind. Some of my favorite people are Mac Miller, Karl Marx and my Iggly from Animal Crossing.

I am so bummed out I studied this school from front to back and ahhh it literally seemed to be my dream school. It had the perfect mix of all kind of people and was set in such a great place. 
There is nothing I can do but I was wondering what it is like for transfer students. Can you transfer after one semester or do you have to do 2 years? 
What is it like to make friends/ how do you make friends? 
Do you feel like because people already knew each other and made friend-groups that it was hard to join? Freshman year is supposed to be one of the best years, do you feel like you missed out on that or did App state make up for it!

kc5tgr,"Sorry, this is another I got in post + lots of questions THANKS","So, I got in to App! Yay. Honestly, I’m happy but at the same time a little terrified. That being said I have a few questions that I tend to compulsively look up every night that I haven’t found answers to.

- how’s the diversity at App? (I’m Latina btw)

- for the communication sciences and disorders major, what’s the living situation? My understanding is that classes are in another building..? I’m not sure if I’m just confused on that

- what are a few things that are essential to have at App?

- is it dumb to pick a school based on the weather it might have? (I’ve been told I’m a good candidate for unc chapel hill &amp; they have a similar major but it’s not the mountains, you know?) 

- does anyone have experience with having a job during school? Did it make everything very difficult? (I want to save up money while in college to worry less about my future) (I’m a worrier)

- car or no car? why? 

- how often did you visit home? Is it weird to go every 2 weeks? (I’m from Charlotte)

- what do you love the most?

- does it snow like REALLY snow? (I was probably a penguin in my past life)

- is it worth the cost? 

Thank you in advance for actually reading through that and helping me out.

Hey everyone, I’m not sure if this is where I should post this, but, I’m looking everywhere I can. I was wondering if anyone here knew how to play bass guitar or knew anyone looking to start a band. I have a lead guitarist, backup guitarist, a drummer and me on vocals and rhythm guitar. I am willing to switch around on instruments as well. We have had this band for a few months now and are really hoping to to make a presence locally. We are all students at App, so if that means anything that’s that. We play a lot of rock, grunge, 90’s, 80’, Beatles, basically a little of everything. I have also written and recorded a song that would sound great with a bass guitar. If you need any more info, let me know !",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/khn1ei/looking_for_a_bass_guitar_player_to_join_my_band/,juansoloh,1,2020-12-21 13:29:46,1,/r/appstate/comments/khn1ei/looking_for_a_bass_guitar_player_to_join_my_band/

ktzjx5,Prospective Student Scholarship Chances?,"
I am a prospective student, currently a junior in high school, graduating in 2022. I am from Illinois and want to go somewhere far and new &amp; exciting for college. However, out of state tuition can be a bit of a kicker when choosing schools, especially given that I want to go into med. App State’s tuition is about the same as in state for Illinois, so it really wouldn’t be much different than staying in state (actually might be cheaper). That being said, I think I may have a decent chance at receiving a scholarship at App when i apply in Fall 2021. If you have received an OOS scholarship let me know what it was/how you got it/ how your stats compare to mine. Note: If you’re comparing your stats to mine, I will definitely not qualify for any need-based financial aid, it will all have to be merit-based. Thank you so much! 

Stats...

•Ethnicity/Finances: Upper-middle class white Female (yearly household income of 250k+, meaning my scholarships will be based mainly off academic achievement)

•GPA: 4.5/4.0 weighted, 4.0 unweighted

•ACT/SAT: took my first act in October, got a 31. Have been studying extremely hard and am taking it 3 more times, hoping to end with a 34-35. Have not taken the SAT yet, my school administers it in March-April.

kvzgwa,App needs to take care of its students.,"Hi all,

I’m a sophomore here, and I’ve always loved this school and this area. I wanted to go here all of highschool and was ecstatic to get in. 

I feel like I made a bad choice. App state only cares about getting more students (past 20k during a pandemic now!) and more money (let’s keep doing contact sports in spite of related clusters!). 

COVID decisions have been handled poorly, the food has gotten more expensive and worse, and there’s no one that has responsibility for anything here. 

Seriously, try getting any problem resolved at app state. You will jump through hoops of people for weeks who point you to a different department. No one takes any responsibility.

This is not new with COVID. Look up old posts and articles about the university only caring about publicity, with no real accountability. During the summer a decade ago when suicides were on the rise on campus, the university responded by no longer reporting them.

There’s a whole industry here of predatory realtors who feed on the student population that the university doesn’t have room for. 
The university isn’t blameless in that either. 

Last semester, you couldn’t have the person next door over in dorms, but they were still making money in football so that was fine. You could go eat at central but not in your dorm kitchen (they don’t make money there!)

And now they’ve pushed back move in dates with no thought to how that’d affect the students. What’s the point if everyone who’s coming has to have a recent COVID test anyway? Did you know they’ve approved some classes to meet in person, on campus in the first 2 weeks. Now those students who got screwed are out of luck.  I reached out and got nothing but buzzwords about data driven decisions. 

And yes, on paper the students can appeal to move in early, but if you go to housings forms, it’s literally not there. I’m looking at it right now. Those students are just out of luck.

But oh boy at least my email has 2 factor identification now! I’ve never felt more in touch with an administrative staff! 

I feel like my voice doesn’t matter. I feel like the students here don’t matter. We’re an ever growing pocketbook for the college, for it’s weird separate corporate food service and for the predatory realtors that rely on app packing students in like sardines.

We need to get real with app state. We need accountability and respect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/kvzgwa/app_needs_to_take_care_of_its_students/,bloons45,9,2021-01-12 15:05:14,85,/r/appstate/comments/kvzgwa/app_needs_to_take_care_of_its_students/

We help developers, publishers, and technology companies form lasting, profitable relationships through business. We also produce the IndieGameBusiness podcast, master classes, and online conferences. This internship will allow for excellent visibility into the business side of the industry and allow for networking opportunities across the industry as well.

Wtf is with the off-campus housing situation?  Any advice? Most landlords have been very condescending if not downright rude and they refuse to do a virtual or solo tour or provide additional pictures....but want me to pay $75 for an application fee. Ummm?? Lol. Not to mention they all have told me I need my parents to sign as a back up...are you kidding me?! I’m in my 30’s. 

I told one of the landlords I had an ESA dog (it’s legit...I need him) and she said “Well we’ll see about that”. Pretty sure it’s against federal law to deny an ESA. Not sure what she meant when she said “well he has to be approved” followed by “ugh well let’s just see if YOU get approved first”....😳 I was so thrown off by how rude she was, I didn’t know what to say. *Lane's Management* or something was the name.

lrj7p8,Transfer from PA,"Hey yall! I am a transfer student (probably) going to Boone this fall! Because of its placement in the middle of nowhere, which is a part of why I love it so much, the problem is how to get from Boone to my home on the Philly main line in Pennsylvania. Should I bring my car down and get a parking pass? Do they cost a lot, and is having a car a complete hassle at App? Considering it is an EIGHT hour drive, and I would not be commuting often maybe 3 times a year, should I just fly? How do I get to the nearest airport?

I love Boone so much, I fell in love when I visited last year and it has been my dream ever since. I just can't think of a perfect way to get to Boone and back without it being 1. expensive and 2. a complete hassle. Eight hours really is not that long a drive for me, I live for road trips! I want to especially consider how much it snows and sometimes parking can be tricky, I just wanted to make the right decision.

Any insight on this helps!!!!! Thank you!!!

lsipne,App State vs UNC-CH,"Greetings,

High school senior from Chapel Hill/Durham here. I just got into the Honors College at App and am very excited. I am also admitted to UNC-Chapel Hill and their honors program which, from the looks of it, isn't as much of a community as App's. Rankings wise, UNC is obviously higher up, but I like the idea of being in App honors and treated as more of an individual than a number. 

App is also quite a bit less expensive since I got the App Excellence Scholarship. 

Undecided major, btw. 

So, I'm just opening it up. If you were me, what would you do? Did anyone here choose App over UNC? How happy are you, and how happy are your friends at UNC? What about Honors if you're familiar? 

I have a lot of other private out of state decisions coming so I might not wind up at either, but this is the most realistic direct comparison at this point. My other most viable school with an acceptance so far is all the way in Minnesota and 1/4 the size of App. 

Thanks so much!

(A little about the kind of person I am for those wondering: I'm extremely into the issues so a politically active campus is a requirement, although not everyone or even close needs to be politically active; I'm pretty artsy and love writing, used to play cello; and I'm very academic, but I dislike cutthroat competition.

I am an App State student performing sensory testing on rum products as part of a class project in the Fermentation Sciences program, with the goal of determining if there are perceptible differences in rums prepared with different ingredients. **The purpose of this post is to ask for volunteers who may be interested in participating in this testing, which will require only one hour of your time and involves tasting and smelling samples of rum**. Testing will be conducted from April 7th through April 9th at Appalachian Panhellenic Hall, with five time slots available to choose from. More information on the structure of the test and the ingredients being tested will be provided at the test site. 

If you are a current student at Appalachian State, over the age of 21, and would like to participate in this testing, please fill out the sign-up form at this link: [Rum Sensory Testing Sign-Up Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvuLMU_jp3Ctv5kAiI4jyD_XLPzMSBhl7wl3qTaRwYublFsg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

We are asking volunteers to indicate a preferred time and an alternate time, as well as your name and contact information so that we may contact you with further instructions prior to testing. We will try our best to accommodate your preferred time, but to ensure safe social distancing practices we may have to ask for you to come in during your alternate time. We greatly appreciate your support and participation.

Sorry to be that annoying potential student asking about campus, but I've looked through some old posts and haven't quite found what I was looking for information-wise.  I'm trying to get a good gauge of the culture on campus and in Boone, so I was wondering if people would be willing to answer some questions.

1. How would you describe the campus culture to someone unfamiliar with ASU?
2. What is the food culture like (ie are there many local/non-fast food restaurants?, are there a variety of cuisines?, etc.)?
3. How has COVID-19 compliance been?  Do people take social distancing and mask-wearing seriously?
4. Would you describe App State as a party school?
5. (Maybe for alumni or upcoming seniors) Do you feel like your education at App State has successfully led you to a decent job within the career path you were aiming for?
6. For people who live off campus, do you feel like you can navigate everywhere you need to go on bike/foot or do you need a car to get around?

mjzxwn,Feelings during COVID (and this semester in general...),"Just wanted to put my thoughts out there and kind of get some stuff off of my chest. This whole semester was/is garbage. From the seemingly endless amounts of work to do (while being purely online) to the admin/professors that don't seem to care whatsoever about the well-being of students, I have had a pretty bad time. Not even to mention the horrible things going on in the country at large (racism against Asian-Americans, random shootings/violence, etc.). I've had/have my own personal experiences with worsening depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. No one seems to care about anything I have to say and the only thing that has been getting me through is writing poetry. To be honest, I know that I'll get through this but damn can life please improve at least a bit? I used to dream about coming to a place as amazing as App but now it just seems like I'm another tiny piece of an organization that doesn't care about the people who literally support its livelihood. To any and everyone reading this, I hope that you get through this, I hope you have people to talk to, and just know that you are loved and cared for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/mjzxwn/feelings_during_covid_and_this_semester_in_general/,AstronomicalTeacher,5,2021-04-04 12:50:35,19,/r/appstate/comments/mjzxwn/feelings_during_covid_and_this_semester_in_general/

mk2xjy,Considering App State as my transfer school.,"I know there’s probably a lot of posts like these and I apologize but I have a few questions. 
1. I’ve heard the winter season can be harsh. I deal with seasonal depression so is this something that might affect me a lot or will there be things to keep me occupied? Is at least warm in the summer? 
2. Is there a lot of parties and social events? I can’t say that I mind attending a social event or two but I have moderate social anxiety. I wanna get out of my comfort zone a little but not too much. 
3. Does anyone know how difficult/engaging the History or English majors are? 
4. Are the dorms spacious or are they a bit cramped?
5. Do they offer nice apartments for college students?

I had just introduced myself to this person and once we got to talking, one of the first things they said was, ""Your whole personality seems really gay to me."" Again, granted, I have no issues with those in the LGBTQ+ community, but this really caught me off guard. What does a gay person's personality look like? What does a straight person's personality look like? I'm openly heterosexual but I can understand that I may come off a bit more flamboyant than other straight guys but since when did flamboyant equal gay? I'm honestly at the point now where I'm just like, why can't I be myself without someone else having some ignorant shit to say? I fully acknowledge the privilege I have as both a male and as someone who is heterosexual so this may be just some shit I delete tomorrow but it really did make me question how many people interpret and judge someone's sexuality based off of random shit that I guess society assigned to certain people.

mvoev6,ATTENTION STEM STUDENTS IN NEED OF CALC BASED PHYSICS 1! IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY!,"
Are you in need of calc-based Physics 1 for your stem degree? If so, keep reading. Physics is known for being a notoriously difficult subject, especially at the intro levels. A great way to knock out this credit is to take it during the summer. Catawba Valley Community College is offering PHY-251 which will transfer to most NC based universities as calc-based Physics 1. The problem is that the class needs at least 7 students to run and there is currently only 1. The class costs $380 (before aid) which is MUCH cheaper then taking it at a four year institution. It is also less rigorous due to it being a cc course. On top of that, it is all online due to COVID. Finally, when you transfer it back to your institution it will not affect your GPA- so all you need to get is a C to pass. There are so many reasons to take this class now if you need it and have some spare time this summer, so please consider signing up for this class so it can run! If you sign up, PM me and I will try to update these posts with how many people are signed up. I will be posting this in multiple NC university subreddits to attract as many students as possible. Enrollment caps at around 20. Class dates are 6/1/2021-7/27/2021. Thank you for reading!

n0436d,Potential Transfer Student! (Fall 2021 or Spring 2022),"Hi everyone! I am currently a first year student at NC State (I started classes here this spring), and I am considering a transfer to Appalachian! 

Can anyone give me some insight on what they look for in applicants, or what my chances are of admission? 

Currently I have enough transferrable credits, and I have a 4.0 GPA on my community college transcript that has 30 credits on it. However, my NC State GPA will likely not be the best (maybe a 3.4 or 3.3?) I don't have an exact answer on my NCSU GPA since this is my first semester at NCSU. Is the GPA for transfers looked at in a cumulative sense, or since my most recent GPA is at NC State, is that the one they look at?

In terms of my major, I am currently undecided in the college of life sciences here at NCSU, but I am looking into education or instrumental music at App State, so insight into those programs would be awesome! 

Finally, how does App State view the S/U grading in their admissions process? I know that app students did not get this option this semester, but NC State students did, so I was wondering if they look at ""S"" negatively. I currently am taking a bunch of STEM courses, and since I would not need them for any graduate programs, I was wondering if taking one or two classes pass fail would be a bad thing. (My advisor said it shouldn't be a problem, but its always nice to get a second opinion)

nis42d,Just my shared experience.,"I’m moving away from
Boone in the next month for law school and felt like it was the right time to share certain experiences I had during my five years living in Boone and going to appstate. 

First off let me say that these experiences were out of the oridinary and not at all entirely representative of my time living in Boone. Also, I understand that Watauga county is considered a progressive area because of the college but with the changes coming to the officer of student diversity I think it’s a good time to share my experience with prospective and current students. Additionally, I think I should mention that I don’t considering myself a minority. My mother is Native American but I’m pale as a ghost like my father. 

I worked all four years of college at a local business in customer service and I had many customers who on a regular basis thought since I was white that I shared their same racist ideologies. They were wrong since both my fiancé and a lot of my family members are of mixed race. Still they would on a regular basis come in and use racial slurs and talk about how they were scared of the (omit racial slur) they saw outside the gas stations at night. 

I tried for months to get these people banned and begged my manager to ban them but the customer is always right even if they are a racist piece of shit I guess. One of the ladies was actually in the middle of spewing some racist shit when one of my regular customers walked in who was African American and she stopped mid sentence and didn’t say a word just paid and left. 

On another occasion me and my fiancé were out having lunch and drinks at elevation. A group of white ladies were sitting down the bar from us and kept looking down the bar at us. Eventually they were so drunk we could hear them saying the N word repeatedly. We mentioned it to the bar tender and he did nothing. Instead of letting my fiancé beat the shit out of them we got our food togo. On the way out we both confronted them and they weren’t afraid to admit their blatant racism and I just told my fiancé to leave while I cussed them out. I’m not afraid to mention the name of the bar cause they allowed this behavior and on more than one occasion from what I’ve heard. There were other similar incidents like this throughout our time living in Boone where people would drive by and yell racial slurs or follow my fiancé around the store instead of me and other cowardly shit like that. 

Fast forward to today I was making a delivery for one of the many courier apps to a residence in Boone. The house was in a nice neighborhood but was way up a dirt road. As a approached the house I noticed a ton of MAGA/Confederate flags which I understand doesn’t automatically make someone racist. But when I saw the signs insinuating they will shoot minorities who trespass that kind of gave it away. Again, this person also thought since I am white it was okay to start making racist comments about BLM. I just dropped their shit at the front door and left. My fiancé delivers for the same app and so do many of my friends. It worries me that she could have just as easily took the same order and who knows what might happen. 

I’m sharing this because I want current and future students to know that just cause it is 2021 and Boone is progressive doesn’t mean that racist people don’t still live around here. Some will remember just a few years ago someone hung a white supremacist banner over river street and I’m not even going to get into the shit I saw/heard at the student protests against racial injustice. 

All that being said I think I should reiterate that my time living in Boone was not bad and the good people outweigh the bad. I just want everyone to be safe and aware of their surroundings, especially students who do gig work or who are new at appstate. It may be hard but don’t let these people trick you out of your position. They want a reaction, they want someone to stoop to their level, and they want an excuse to call the cops and make you as fucking miserable as they are.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/nis42d/just_my_shared_experience/,Lukelmarshall24,1,2021-05-22 17:06:05,12,/r/appstate/comments/nis42d/just_my_shared_experience/

nkvj9h,The Futurist Society," 

Hi everyone! My name is Damian and I'm an engineering student at UC Irvine. I'm creating a club called The Futurist Society and I'm trying to expand it to other campuses.

In this club we'll discuss future technologies like flying cars and reusable rockets, and form a network of students excited for the future! The pandemic is a rough time to do club stuff, so we'll also be prepping a lot for next year!

For now we'll all just be on one Discord, but once we get some momentum going we can create chapters for each school. If technology and futurism interest you, come check us out!

We still don’t have her housing assignment yet, so no idea what part of campus she’ll be living in.

Suggestions for clothing, anyone? Will her Dic Martens be good enough as winter boots or do we need something else? Does she need a wax jacket? Or can she get away with a parka of some sort?

Should we get her an eno? She had one previously and didn’t use it all that much, so we left it behind when we moved. Seems like eno-ing is a thing, so maybe it’s time to replace it?

Is it fairly safe at App? Should we be investing in a taser or something? Also, should she not work her first semester? We’re definitely not made of money over here, so not sure we can afford for her not to have a part-time job. We’re wondering if work study would be a good option.

I know I’m asking a ton of questions. My other kids are doing community college courses, so she’s the first to go straight into a four-year.

on76ic,RateMyProfessors for internships: New site by some Georgia Tech kids,"Hey everyone, I’m a recent grad at Georgia Tech - some friends and I have been working for a while on building a review site for internships/co-ops called [Canary](https://canarystudent.com/), after we got tired of: 1. Internship job postings being notoriously ""meh"" and 2. Glassdoor providing no real info. It’s made by college students (us) and is anonymous. We're trying to democratize the whole internship process by asking questions that students actually care about, like if your work was actually impactful, what software tools you used, etc.

I thought I'd throw it in here since hopefully y'all and other schools could find it useful too! We really focused on user privacy as much as we can (your name/email is never displayed with the review or shared with 3rd parties.) Also we're actively developing, so don't hesitate to reach out via DM with suggestions or leave a comment on what you think of the platform.

It's blown up at a few schools, but it'd be awesome to get some experiences/reviews from App State students on the site. If you want to help contribute to the project, **you can share your previous internship at** [**canarystudent.com/submit**](https://canarystudent.com/submit), it takes about 3 mins.

Secondly, I wanted to know if freshmen are supposed to get a refrigerator and/or microwave? A friend of mine called housing and asked, and the answer was yes, but they will live in a different building, whereas I am going to be living in Cannon Hall and the view of the room looked like there wasn't going to be a place for a fridge, and the website said it didn't come with one and didn't mention any exceptions for freshmen. 

Lastly, are we allowed to have a coffee pot in our room? My older sister has been at App for over a year and said if it is under 1200 watts it is allowed but in case it could have changed I just wanted to make sure.

otzik8,Food for thought,"Hello I just thought I would share my feelings about Appalachian state university, I loved this school but that has all changed. I graduated in 3years with a 4year degree, started in your school from high school with 52 credit hours. I didn't even take the gmat I took the GRE. I was told the reason I wasn't admitted was because my gmat score was too low. There is alot I do not know and do not understand but I do know that I will not be back at Appalachian state for anything, I do not even want to go for graduation. This ""accident"" has made even the thought of the school sickening to me. I just do not understand how the dean of any department could mess up so bad that they tell someone they have been accepted and then within a few days tell them it was an accident that they were not actually admitted. What kind of cruel joke is that, I'm sure someone got something out of it besides for the hate and dishonesty I now have for Appalachian state and their joke of a school. I still cannot get over the fact that someone with a doctorate could be so sloppy and uninterested in their work that an error like this could occur. Then they tried to make up things to make it seem like it wasn't as much of their fault as it actually was. I think more than anything I am disappointed that the university I cared about and thought that it cared about me would treat any human being like this, toying with their emotions and using them like a pawn in their game to get what they want. No one will be disciplined by this mistake. They will get to keep their job and keep doing what they have been doing because it does not affect them only other people. I would say I hope this does not happen to anyone else in the future but I know it will because no one on the staff no matter the degree really cares about the students or even the education they receive, or even doing their job to the best of their ability to avoid mistakes like this  all they care about is the paycheck they recieve and as long as the issues they create by being careless and lazy do not affect that they could care less.

“Appalachian State University is my first choice and my dream school because it checks all the boxes for what I am looking for in a college. I was looking for a middle-sized college, in a cooler climate and an emphasis on nature. Once I learned that App State was up in the mountains I quickly fell in love, I don’t do so well in the heat. Furthermore, my Grandma and her husband reside in North Carolina, so my family and I went to visit them for the sole purpose of visiting App. While touring in person I fell in love even more. From learning about all the opportunities to get outdoors to living in Boone I couldn’t get enough. I truly saw myself thriving at App. Aside from that after researching I also learned that App has an amazing Exercise science program which is the major I want to study. My grandma’s husband’s daughter graduated from App in 2013 and I was able to have a sit-down talk with her about the app after my tour and she had only good things to say about App. She informed me that at App she was a student ambassador and I really hoped that if I went to an app I could become one. I love being involved in my school and community and I could bring my leadership skills to App. I hope I can be given the chance to call myself a Mountaineer!”",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/oyjju6/app_state_application_interest_statement/,Formal-Entertainer18,1,2021-08-05 10:34:56,7,/r/appstate/comments/oyjju6/app_state_application_interest_statement/

p5rv5w,Flood info for new students,"A lot of you may be in boone for the first time and this storm will probably introduce you to the typical boone floods.  Anyone else please offer your advice in the comments but here are a few tips to keep you safe and not looking like an idiot.

1.  Never, ever, EVER park in the 321 side of the boone mall parking lot if there are storms in the forecast.  Your car will flood and be in display for the town to laungh at.

2. Never drive through floodwaters.  If it’s more than a puddle find another way, especially if you are new here there are intersections that look nice and cross able but can be two or more feet deep.

3.  Don’t try to walk through rushing water.  You’re gonna have a bad time.

4.  Be at the right side of town before the floodwaters hit.  If it’s bad the town can basically split near walmart and you aren’t getting from one side to the other for a long while.  

5. Educate yourself, find your location in the [FEMA maps](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home) and you can get an idea of where the floodwaters will reach.  During your time at App you’re going to see pretty  much anything and everything that’s not zone X flood.  

6. Be careful on the mountain backroads.  Especially after days of rain you can get slides, trees down, and washouts.  Go slow and stay alert even after the rain has stopped.

I hope this helps some of y’all, remember to laugh at the cars flooded at the mall when you drive past.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/p5rv5w/flood_info_for_new_students/,Kwiatkowski,1,2021-08-16 19:30:27,11,/r/appstate/comments/p5rv5w/flood_info_for_new_students/

p5w82q,Advice Needed : First Year Bio Major,"I am planning on going a pre-dental track which is why I chose Bio as my major. I kind of want to switch to a Psych major, but I feel like as a Bio major I will be fulfilling a lot of the necessary classes needed for a pre-dental track. It’s like I’ll have to take those classes eventually, so I might as well (if this logic is flawed PLEASE educate me. i’m so used to the “you take this class at this specific time” mentality). 
ANYWAY, my advisor placed me into any chem class and chem lab that was open because I need it for my major. I wanted a specific chem teacher and her class wasn’t even full, but my advisor had already placed me into Dr. Libby Puckett’s class. When I tried dropping it and going into the class I wanted - it wouldn’t let me. I’m so scared based off of what Ive seen on rate my professor. Reviews from 2012- 2020 have consistently mentioned her alleged tendency to be condescending and/or seem unapproachable. Has anyone had Dr. Puckett’s class or heard of her as a teacher? 
On the AsULearn page for my chem lab, I saw that it’s possible to drop a chem lecture, but stay in the lab. I would never have thought of that, but now that I know it’s a possibility— I’m planning on talking to my advisor about it. I’m very anxious (unmedicated + diagnosed…) &amp; it can be hard for me to speak up about my questions sometimes so to have a teacher who allegedly answers condescendingly will not be a good fit for me. Also, chem is already a hard subject in general so I really want a good teacher (which i’m sure she is) that’s a good fit for me so that I know that when I put in 100% — I earned my score. (i’ve had times where I put in 100%, but bc of the teacher I didn’t do as well, but still managed to get at least a B — my old school had an issue where your grade depended on the teacher you got). Honestly, I don’t feel ready to take chem right now anyway &amp; either way I will be talking to my advisor. I just wanted a different perspective. 
And I know it’s like, “You’re saying all of this before you even met the teacher,” but I want to make this decision before August 20th. 
Sorry, I know I probably sound whiny and illogical, but this has me stressed. 
Another thing- I was at 18 credit hours, but got AP credit for psych so I was able to remove my psych class. Now i’m at 15 ch. If I removed the chem lecture I’ll definitely fall below the recommended ch for a semester.According to degree works, I’ve earned 23 hours from my APs so maybe I don’t have to worry about the recommended ch right now. If it is and issue, I’ll ask my advisor if there’s a class I can be placed into that will compensate",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/p5w82q/advice_needed_first_year_bio_major/,cindylouwhostan,1,2021-08-16 23:54:50,0,/r/appstate/comments/p5w82q/advice_needed_first_year_bio_major/

pctsdm,COVID-19 and App this Fall,"The university is not at all handling the new covid cases well. The emergency management dept. is the one taking care of all the sick people but they’re so severely understaffed that it takes them more than twice the amount of time to do anything. The university was not well-equipped for so many covid cases this year, even though they moved everything in-person, I mean they should have expected a fair amount of cases just when they even thought about it. Now they’re sending so many people home, risking their families too, while those isolating on campus are being held in this god-aweful pre-WWII built East Residence Hall, with such terrible food options that are worse than the dining hall, tbh.
The emails from Sheri about the vaccinated numbers might be misleading as some of her phrasing connotes that getting a vaccine means you don’t really need to worry about covid. When in reality many of the new cases are in those that are already vaccinated. Yes, a lot of those are asymptomatic, but many aren’t. Esp. If you took the J&amp;J vaccine, you might get some pretty bad symptoms.
New students have been partying like crazy. The first week you could literally hear the party music for miles. Frats and sororities are going wild with parties and rush events almost everyday. All the tables in Rivers Street Cafe are friggin’ joined together for god knows what reason. AppalCart is not sanitized well enough. At this rate, I think it’s inevitable that everything will move online again like last year. They’re acting like the pandemic is a thing of the past or that it’s not that big of a risk anymore since “so many have got vaccinated,” when it is still very much alive and well esp. with the new delta variant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/pctsdm/covid19_and_app_this_fall/,wannabeasspiggy,1,2021-08-27 15:04:11,16,/r/appstate/comments/pctsdm/covid19_and_app_this_fall/

A lot of you have commented and helped with each post. Now, I decided to share what happened to me this past saturday. I was SA’d. I spoke to emergency services and they took down my information and put together a file with what happened. Yesterday, I went into the counseling center and a counselor spoke to me. She gave me some advice, and mostly told me it wasnt my fault, healing takes time, she’s so sorry it happened to me, it’s definitely SA, and that she can help me set up an appointment for meeting a counselor more regularly. I know I have the option of filing a report. I know me filing a report might help other girls because this guy IS on dating apps, he WILL match with other girls, and he DOES live on campus, and told me he got a job at the dining hall. He could do it again. I will always suck for not filing a report. But I was told by others who have experienced this that the authorities couldn’t do anything because it’s “he said/she said” &amp; even if I do it anonymously, they will ask him what happened (he’ll lie) and he’ll definitely understand it was me who reported him. My dorm is less than a 5 minute walk away from his, and my chest feels weird any time I think I see someone who looks like him. I wish there was a quick fix to coping. I wanted him to maybe say sorry or reach out so I could tell myself he didn’t understand what he did, but he ironically left me on open and hasn’t contacted me. I thought this person was a friend. We spoke everyday, had a streak, and now radio silence. I guess he knows what he did and just doesn’t care. That will always hurt. 
Before I got ready to post this I went to the dining hall with my roommate and found myself unable to buy my food because I was pretty sure it was him at the register and he shares his location with me and it said we were in the same location. 
Everytime I think I’m making progress I see a new example of how messed up I am. I always remember different parts of what happened. All the times I repeated no. When I told him why dont you get that no means no and he said “what did you expect” and I told him I thought you and I were just going to be friends and he laughed. How do you pretend to be someone’s friend for THAT long — with 0 insinuation of anything other than a platonic relationship with the 1 goal of doing what you did the whole time? Being restrained.

qgeucp,Here's what's happening with redistricting/gerrymandering in our state - Sen. Jeff Jackson,"“Hey Jeff, what’s happening with redistricting?”

It's not good, but here's the latest.

We’ve got three levels of maps being drawn right now: State House (120 seats), state Senate (50 seats), and federal House (14 seats).

Here are a few basics to know:

1. Republicans are in the majority in the state legislature, so they have 100% control over how these maps are drawn. Specifically, majority party \*leadership\* is in control of the process. The Governor isn’t allowed to veto maps (a quirk of our state constitution), so the majority party can do whatever they want here, subject only to potential court involvement down the road.
2. The majority party has resisted any consideration of redistricting reform, which has been proposed countless times (the first bill I ever filed was an independent redistricting bill). Those bills are never even allowed to be heard in committee, let alone come to a vote, let alone pass. They can simply block it, and it appears that's what they'll do so long as they're in the majority. We don't have a referendum process in our state where you can collect a bunch of signatures to put something on the ballot, so the majority party can simply prevent redistricting reform from happening as long as they're in charge.
3. The majority party allowed a small number of public hearings on their proposed maps. They were purely for show so they could claim that they held some public hearings. The phrase ‘dog and pony show’ would be appropriate here.

So what do the new maps look like?

Well, there are a number of draft maps that have been filed. We don’t know which ones the majority party’s leadership will settle on yet, but we can tell from the drafts that the options range from heavily gerrymandered to extremely gerrymandered.

I expect they will pass the new maps within the next few weeks, which takes us into November.

That’s significant, because candidate filing is in December.

That means there’s an extra element of incumbent protection added to this process in the form of a highly compressed timeline for potential challengers.

How so? Well, let’s say you want to run for state Senate. Ok - what district do you live in? Who are you running against? You don’t know yet, and you won’t know until a few weeks before you have to file. You have virtually no time to prepare a run. And then the primary is in March. So if you’re challenging an incumbent in a primary it’s a 90-day sprint with maybe three weeks prep time. That’s the kind of crunch incumbents love to put challengers in.

Redistricting is - by far - the most significant thing our state legislature does. It sets the table for the policy agenda for the rest of the decade. And, as you can see, it is a top-to-bottom example of how the temptation of power corrupts elected officials.

Just as I expect we’ll see in some states run by Democrats, by the way.

Absolutely no good news here. But that’s the situation.

r4lsl1,Should I apply to their nursing program/attend there during the spring semester 2022?,"Hello! I am in a very sticky situation at the moment. I just recently graduated high school and I am attending a community college. Throughout high school I’ve always taken courses that align with the prerequisites for the nursing program. During the time that I am at the community college I have taking a anatomy class and a pre-Calc class. I also took my nursing a class, however, I did not pass. I am discouraged that I did not pass but I am willing to try it again during the summer or the next spring semester that is coming. So far I believe that community college classes are a bit easier but I am willing to prepare myself for classes at appstate. The only classes I need to apply for a App State nursing program is a microbiology, anatomy two, nutrition, and a ethics class. Right now I am wanting to apply to upstate nursing program and I am wanting to go to the University. But I have been having thoughts of going to the University of Charlotte instead. I am wondering if I applied to one school if it will be more beneficial for me to get into nursing programs add a better chance. So far I have been making A’s in my classes for my community college. I graduated high school with a 4.0 gpa. And I am also wondering how hard are the classe at APP (science wise)? I don’t want to ruin my GPA for my community college, and I am not sure if that is a factor. Thanks! If I finish those classes that I need I could apply for the nursing program early but I won’t have my CNA certificate if I don’t do it during the spring. So I am also still debating if I should finish those courses all in a semester or take some for the spring and then wait for fall 2022.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/r4lsl1/should_i_apply_to_their_nursing_programattend/,Intelligent_Deer_664,1,2021-11-28 22:04:45,0,/r/appstate/comments/r4lsl1/should_i_apply_to_their_nursing_programattend/

In the fight for safe campuses and workplaces alike, it must be made abundantly clear to all students and university staff: a “vaccination alone” strategy is not sufficient to keep COVID-19 in check. The growing opposition among educators and students must become part of an international movement of workers and youth to close schools and nonessential workplaces as part of a global strategy to eliminate the virus.

I am a student, and back in October I got my first ever service animal (Black Lab). I am wanting to get back into lifting and going to the gym, but having her complicates things a little.

It was recommended to me by the trainer that I look for a smaller gym to try and join, since the larger gyms with lots of people can be less accommodating and people can be less understanding. Basically, I am hoping to find somewhere that I can actually get to know the staff, so that they know my dog is okay to be around there, and my dog knows them (incase my dog ever needs to alert them).

Does anyone have any recommendations? I wish I could just go to the SRC or something, but that is not an option I feel like. 

Heck, I would even be willing to pay someone good money to let me have access to their garage gym since it would allow me to keep my dog extra safe.

su0t0m,Make Suicide Prevention at Priority at AppState!,"Hi 'Neers!

My name is Sarah Cothren and I am an AppState alumna and the current Associate Area Director for the North Carolina Chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). Suicide prevention became important to me while I was at AppState because I lost my friend and roommate, Savannah, to suicide during my last year at App. 

I know that there are many students who are passionate about suicide prevention, so I wanted to let you all know about an opportunity. Each year, AppState in conjunction with AFSP-NC holds the [AppState Out of the Darkness Campus Walk](https://afsp.org/appstate). This is an event that helps to fundraise for suicide prevention efforts (research, programs, advocacy, and loss &amp; healing support). Our walk will be held on Saturday, April 23rd at Sanford Mall from 1-4pm. 

The AppState Out of the Darkness Walk Co-Chairs, Riley Kiefer and Zaeontae Robinson, are hoping to find a few students who would be interested in serving on the Walk Planning Committee in the **Internal Outreach** role and **External Outreach** role. Internal Outreach would be in charge of walker recruitment and External Outreach would be over sponsorship procurement and off-campus walker recruitment.

If you think you might be interested, please reach out to our walk chairs at appstateootdwalk@gmail.com more information! If you have any questions about AFSP, please reach out to me at [scothren@afsp.org](mailto:scothren@afsp.org)!

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. If you're an alum of AppState, please consider showing your support for the current students by joining the [AppState Alumni team](https://supporting.afsp.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&amp;teamID=287384) and raising money for suicide prevention at AppState!",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/su0t0m/make_suicide_prevention_at_priority_at_appstate/,afspnorthcarolina,1,2022-02-16 12:00:34,1,/r/appstate/comments/su0t0m/make_suicide_prevention_at_priority_at_appstate/

t3r8jj,Thoughts on App's graphic design program + internships ?? (thinking of transferring to UNCC for digital media),"Hi! So I’m currently a freshman attending App and am currently trying to decide whether or not I should transfer to UNCC because I feel like they’d have a program better suited for me.

I initially hated App and wanted out after the first semester, but recently, I feel like it’s grown on me and I feel more happy and comfortable here. I’ve been trying to weigh the pros and cons but am still having a hard time deciding which school would be best for me.

I’m a graphic design major and looking at the art programs UNCC has (studio, graphic, illustration, digital media), their digital media program seemed very appealing to me. It looks like it would concentrate more on animation and game design, which I really like the sound of since I’m looking into a career in the videogame industry. I feel like App’s studio art and graphic design are more geared toward just regular studio art practices or advertising/marketing.

Also, I was thinking of trying to get an internship maybe in my junior or senior year. To be completely honest, I don't know anything about getting an internship in college and what I should be doing to prepare for it or how to make the process easier for myself, but I know I want to do it. I’m assuming that the area you’re in has a lot of bearing on the availability of internships, so I thought that being in a big city like Charlotte would mean more internship opportunities.

So I’d love to hear about how other people have found App’s art programs! Is it good? Comparing it to UNCC, is it better? the same, maybe? And if any art majors have any experience/stories with finding internships or jobs relating to their degree, I would love to hear about that too! I was wondering if fellow art majors had difficulty finding success with this since I’ve been quite nervous about it after hearing one too many starving artist jokes…

As of right now, I think the graphic design program is okay. I feel like I’m doing quite well with it. My drawing teacher even encouraged me to do studio art instead because he felt like I would fit in very well there. The only reason I didn’t make the switch was that I felt that graphic design would be more employable. Though I just can’t help but wonder if there could be another program at Charlotte that would better suit me.

The quality of the art programs for both schools is honestly the deciding factor for me but I am also thinking about a couple of other stuff like housing and making friends.

I feel like I’m not far off saying Boone has a housing crisis and that was one of my concerns when thinking of continuing studying here. It seems to be such a hassle trying to find good and affordable housing in this town. And also, making friends has been a STRUGGLE for me here. Everyone here is nice for the most part, but I’m having a problem finding a connection with them and finding my people:( I wanted to join a club but the only ones I can think of joining would be POC, Asian-American-related organizations. But the last time I checked on those kinds of clubs, they didn’t seem active? I even considered joining a sorority a bit but decided against it, it doesn't seem like my thing.

I really want to like App! I’m trying to find more reasons to stay, but most of the reasons I’m given for why Boone is great are outdoor activity-related, which isn’t really my thing:( I truly want to stay and am trying to find more things to convince myself to. So please, if you can give me any advice on what I should do or what I should be thinking about, I’d greatly appreciate it! &lt;3

TLDR: Graphic design freshman trying to compare App State’s graphic design with UNCC’s digital media to find program that fits best for someone trying to work in the video game industry. Wondering about internship/job-related success for art majors in the area. Struggling to find good housing in Boone + making friends. Would appreciate advice! &lt;3",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/t3r8jj/thoughts_on_apps_graphic_design_program/,sabrinasbs,1,2022-02-28 17:02:46,4,/r/appstate/comments/t3r8jj/thoughts_on_apps_graphic_design_program/

teckk2,Computer Information Systems (CIS) Degree at App State?,"As a senior in high school, deciding on a major was more difficult for me than some of my friends. I felt split on getting a degree in the Business field or a degree in IT/CS, but I was really excited to learn about Computer Information Systems, which sort of fuses the two together to my understanding.

I now have to decide between pursuing this degree at Charlotte, App State, ECU, or OU. So far I’ve been accepted everywhere I applied except NC State, which I’m supposed to get a decision from by March 30th. Though they dont technically offer an MIS degree, I would consider going to NCSU because it’s close to home and there’s something to be said about their reputation. I have to make my final decision by May 1st.

So, I’d love to hear about everyone’s experiences at App State, specifically when it comes to anyone majoring in Computer Information Systems. Even better if you have experience with or know somebody who attends another university I listed. I’m really having a tough time narrowing it down past this point, so any perspective you can add is much appreciated.

I’ve toured the campus recently and I loved the mountain feel and the cold weather, though I am concerned about getting bored in town. Do you ever feel like there’s not enough things to do? Do you ever get stuck on campus because of icy roads in the winter?

One thing that definitely stands out about App State to me is the focus on affordability relative to other universities I’m considering.

tfimxe,App State vs Community College?,"Hi there.

I was accepted into App State a little while ago. I stated I was interested in Computer Science, however I am hesitant on going because I will be away from friends and family. I'm a very introverted person who has spent most of their life playing video games and making digital illustrations; I've been sheltered and in my house most of my life. Socializing does not come easy for me at all. I am debating whether to go to App State or stay locally, attending community college. 

(As for why I'm going to college for comp sci and not pursuing digital illustration: I feel my career in digital illustration would not be secure enough for me, and if possible, I could do digital illustration as a side-hustle. However, from what I've heard, the comp sci course load is no joke, and I likely won't have as much time to hone my craft in drawing as much as I would want to. My goal is to land a job with a small company where I can have work-life balance, a stable income, and enough time to pursue digital illustration.)

Did anyone have a similar experience between choosing App State and community college? Why did you choose App State?",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/tfimxe/app_state_vs_community_college/,eppao,1,2022-03-16 10:14:58,0,/r/appstate/comments/tfimxe/app_state_vs_community_college/

tjknzw,Grad program app decision timeline?,"Hey everyone :) I know I’m prob being overzealous with this but I’m just wondering how quick App usually is with reaching a decision on graduate applications once they’ve been submitted. I couldn’t really get a clear answer when searching online. I know there is an interview day for my program so I would have to be invited to that first, and then after that they would make decisions regarding an acceptance. On the program webpage it says the final deadline is July 1 (which seems hella late to me js) and the priority deadline was March 15 (which I got my app in by). I vaguely remember reading that they would be reviewing applications as they came in so that would lead me to believe that admissions are rolling but I’m still unsure of how long the timespan is and the thought of having to wait 2-3 more months for an answer seems crazy to me. Do you guys think it be worth it to reach out to the graduate admissions office or maybe even my specific program director? I have a couple of other options I’m waiting to hear back from but App is definitely my top choice school!! I’m just a weird ball of excitement but also nerves so this waiting game is killing me lol.

u1cult,Fundraising event at Comeback Shack! This Wednesday!,"Hi friends!!

I've recently picked up a position as director for high country event coordination for a non-profit called the Angel Band Foundation - our goal is to provide music and musical opportunities to those who would otherwise be unable to experience them.

We donate instruments and arrange events and all kinds of other things - or at least, that's the dream! The foundation operates primarily out of Trinity, NC, and I'm in charge of developing our high country chapter.

The first small event planned is a fundraising day at Comeback Shack this Wednesday, 4/13! 

If you're interested, it would mean a lot to see some support there. More importantly, it would mean a lot to keep your eyes open for more ABF events in the future!

ubema5,Scary ghost guards of appstate,"So, as a fellow appstate student, I have heard numerous tales of ghosts that haunt the appstate library. Never believing them myself, I did. One night, I went to the library, the library is haunted, with ghosts. I was prancing up the staircase of the library when I heard a faint whisper, “can I see your app card.” I quickly was frightened and immediately scared. There was no guard near me, so clearly, this freaked me out. Legend has it, there were two guards, treytable and John Paul jones, who worked at the appstate library. They are now ghosts. which means…they are dead. Being dead and being a ghost means that you haunt wherever you are. They haunt the library. So, from the 11pms to the early 7ams, you very well most likely definitely for sure genuinely positivity will hear “can I see your app cards” be aware, if you do not have your appcards, you very might as well hear “you can also log into your AsULearn.” So beware appstate appalachians, or you might be possessed by treytable and John Paul jones. But do not fret, for they aren’t real cops and John Paul jones weighs 90 pounds. Nvm he’s a ghost. Ghosts do not weight any weighs.

v2m4lv,There’s been a lot of interest in the medical marijuana bill in our state legislature. It will probably come to a vote in the state Senate *tomorrow* - but still might not become law. Here’s the situation. - Sen. Jeff Jackson,"Tl;dr: Will probably pass the state Senate, but unclear - at best - if it can pass the state House.

Versions of this medical marijuana have been filed many times. What made this time different was the legislator who filed it: Sen. Bill Rabon.

He’s a very high-ranking Republican Senator and having his name on this bill suddenly brought it to life.

As he explained in committee, his wife had a severe illness. While medical marijuana “might not have given her any extra days, it would have made the days she had left better.” That’s why it’s called the “NC Compassionate Care Act.”

He also brought in a number of veterans who suffer from PTSD to speak to the committee about their strong preference for medical cannabis over the “combat cocktail” they got from the VA that just leaves them groggy. Their remarks were very powerful.

The internal politics of this issue are a little complicated. This has been the rare issue that causes a split within the Republican caucus. Very roughly put, it splits the country club conservatives from the cultural conservatives.

In my eight years here, bills that split the Republican caucus almost always get set aside. But because Sen. Rabon is a powerful committee chairman, he was able to force a vote in committee last summer.

It passed, but with several Republicans voting no - which, again, is exceptionally rare. (I’m on that committee and voted for it and I’m honestly not sure if it would have passed without Democratic votes, but it was only a voice vote so it’s impossible to know for sure.)

But after it passed committee, it stalled. It didn’t make it to the Senate floor for a vote. That was a bad sign. We adjourned for the year.

That was last year. Now we’re back in session. Yesterday was our first day. And suddenly it’s coming to the Senate floor for a vote - **probably tomorrow.**

That means it will pass the Senate. Since I’ve been here, I’m pretty sure every single bill that’s come to the Senate floor has passed. They’re batting something like 3,000 for 3,000 in the last eight years. Why? Because if it’s not going to pass, it just doesn’t come to the floor.

So it will pass on our chamber, but prospects are uncertain at best on the House side. There is no one as powerful as Sen. Rabon who cares about this as much as he does on the House side. An internal split is going to be harder to deal with if none of the Republican House leaders are willing to really push for this.

That means we have a wide range of possible outcomes at this moment. It could end up passing, or being quietly sidelined, or it could get lumped in with another bill as part of global negotiation resolving lots of disputes. It’s the second day of session so no one really knows yet.

I’ve gotten a ton of email about this, so that’s the latest. I’ll keep you posted.

Best,

Sen. Jeff Jackson",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/v2m4lv/theres_been_a_lot_of_interest_in_the_medical/,JeffJacksonNC,1,2022-06-01 13:18:44,0,/r/appstate/comments/v2m4lv/theres_been_a_lot_of_interest_in_the_medical/
v3a9st,Housing Megathread: Have Housing questions? Look here first!,"It seems like every time I'm on here there's nothing but the same housing questions so here's some advice and resources.  

**When should I start looking for housing for ___ school year?**    
Immediately! Housing in Boone is famously hard to find these days. Most places will fill up by March before the following fall semester. You will be left with the leftovers if you do not get onto a list before then. Places to avoid if possible: **The Cottages** This is a party area. It is constantly covered in trash. Terrible management. **The Standard** I haven't lived here but I've heard it's ridiculously overpriced.  

**Tips for this**  
* Accept that you will probably not get a perfect situation no matter what. Most every renting company in Boone is looking to screw you. Try and get lucky.  
* Call the apartment complex even if the website says they're full. They will probably be able to tell you if there is someone looking for a sublease, or they will get you on a list for the following year. This is how I managed to get a Skyline Terrace apt. I called in August of the previous year and got on a list for the next year.  
* Look at the App State housing website. [Here](https://offcampushousing.appstate.edu/) . This is not always the most helpful but it's a good place to start.  
* When you do decide on a place, keep watch for hidden costs. Most places don't love to advertise when a utility isn't included. For example, I, in a 1 bed 1 bath, pay about 170$ a month in utilities. 80$ for electric, 50$ for water and 40$ for optional faster internet. So even though my rent is technically 940$, in order to actually use my apt it's about 1110$.  
* ALWAYS TOUR THE APT FIRST. I didn't do this during the covid year and got stuck in an ADA 3 bed 2 bath instead of the 3 bed 3 bath that I was paying for. The housing company told me tough luck.  

**I need a roommate / I need to sublease my apartment / I need to pick up a sublease**  
This is a bit easier. Since everyone is so hungry for housing, finding a roommate / sublease is fairly painless.  

**Tips for this**  
* Same as above, call the apt complex you want to live in and ask if they have available subleases. Most apt complexes also have a roommate matching service that you can use. You may end up with people you don't like (ask me how I know) so use with caution.  
* Use the Appalachian Classifieds. This is the most common piece of advice on housing threads here. It is the largest classifieds group for the Boone area. It is on Facebook and you will need to be approved before you can see anything. I think it has a fairly high success rate. Also easy to get cheap furniture on there if you need it. Link [HERE](https://www.facebook.com/groups/175538369221046/)  
* If you are going to pick up a sublease, make sure to ask if its going to be renewable. I saw a girl on the classifieds trying to sublease her apartment for just the month of July. The person who picks that up will move in July first and need to be out July 31st. Not ideal, don't get stuck in that situation on accident.  

**When do I get my room number and roommate?**
For most places, on and off campus, you'll get this in July before the semester starts. Sometimes you won't for off campus. I've had times where I didn't meet my roommates until move in day.

v4cfoj,The Red Dot House on Howard's Knob (A PODCAST!),"Hi r/Appstate

Myself and my cohost have spent the better half of 2 years creating a podcast on the infamous red dot house that used to sit a top Howard's Knob.

The house became infamous due to its black paint, and central red dot at the center of the homes A-frame and became a source of constant rumors in the High Country. Many people on this sub may be familiar with the house. For those students who attend ASU now - join us on a story about a legendary mansion that used to tower over the ASU campus. 

The Red Dot Podcast (link below), is the most complete rendition of the house and the man who built told yet. The podcast is very much still ongoing, so please DM me if you have any personal stories or knowledge of the house you think would be relevant to share!

Are you throwing a party and want to cover everybody’s music taste?

Do this with [catalist.fm](http://catalist.fm/)

It’s a pretty simple concept: create a shared playlist in catalist.fm, get a QR code back. Print or post that QR code wherever (online, on flyers, you can do a lot of things with it e.g. guerrilla marketing?)

Guests scan the QR code and add songs to your playlist. As the creator, you can configure some settings around the type of music to add to the playlist (only happy songs, no long songs etc.).

We’ve used it with some success, and hoping others will find it useful too.

The website etc. all is free, you'll probably just need a premium Spotify account. Just you, the guests don't need one.

Let us know what you think, [join us on our Discord](https://discord.gg/axG736QzFS) if you have more thoughts!

vdchyc,The Village of Meadowview,"Massive warning for anyone who's looking into living off campus! I know the consensus is that The Standard and The Cottages are places to be avoided, but I haven't seen as much talk about what a nightmare Meadowview is. Absolutely positively avoid this place at all costs. 

I have unfortunately been here for two years and am finally moving out in a few months. During this time I have had maintenance and apartment staff just let themselves into my apartment AND bedroom with little to no warning, never seem to have a place to park that isn't far as hell from my apartment, had my packages held hostage in the office because they only allow you to pick them up during very specific time frames, and was threatened with eviction because I had a visitor over for 3 days.

Today I was informed that I have essentially 5 days to move almost all of my stuff out of the apartment so renovations can be done, and anything not moved will be discarded and I will be charged for that. Even though my roommate and I will be leaving in a few months, they can't seem to wait that long to force us out of our living space. 

On top of all of this, the rent is outrageously high especially for how miserable my experience living here has been. I'm paying damn near $800/month for a single bedroom in a two bedroom apartment.

In a few months I'm moving into the bottom level of a duplex that has two bedrooms and one bathroom (no roommate, just two bedrooms to myself) and has oil heating, no washing machine, and was built in the 1930's and is probably haunted, and it seems like heaven compared to being stuck at The Village of Meadowview for another year.

You can only log in once you verify your appstate.edu school email! (you'll receive a 5 digit code in your inbox)

A lot of hard work went into it so make sure you check it out if you need anything for the upcoming semesters!

Hello everyone!

I've created a national student club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We discuss flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We are building a Wiki of many types of future tech as a resource for people looking to know more about technology. We also have plans to start doing projects as our organization gets more established. We also have guest talks from speakers who work in tech!

Right now there is no chapter being formed at this school, but we are always looking for people to help us start new ones for the next school year! Being one of our leaders could be a great opportunity in shaping your resume and in making connections! We also welcome anyone who just wants to join for our discussions.

We have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! If you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!

vey5e9,Honest thoughts on App?,"I just wanted to get some opinions from current students. For reference, I'm planning on transferring in spring 2023. I went to NC State for my freshman year (2021-2022) and I... kind of hated it. I didn't do great because of how miserable I was there (my GPA is garbage), but I did initially get into App when I applied in fall 2020. I'm interested in majoring in environmental science with a minor in studio art, but my career goals are currently up in the air. I've heard great things about the community but a lot of mixed stuff about housing and academics. I've also heard that the university is becoming a lot more selective, so I'm worried I may not even get in again.

vnimzk,What's up with speeders being pulled over by 3 or 4 cops every night?,"As someone who doordashes at night and is predominantly a night owl, I see a lot of Boone's night scene.

Usually, the cop situation is pretty chill up until the end of the month, there are several speed traps along the main roads for a few days and the next month it resets.

But I've noticed over the last month that like half the time someone gets pulled over, there are 3 or 4 cop cars pulled up behind them. I lived in Charlotte before I came up here for ASU, and even with the much bigger population I'd only seen this a few times. What's up with that?

Only explanation I can think of is that they're being more wary of people under the influence, but part of me is worried they're doing random drug searches?

Not that I've got anything to worry about if the latter is the case, but it would suck to have my cluttered car searched while doordashing.

Universities and many things (in general) in my country have COMPLETELY different systems so please understand that I might sound dumb with the questions.

1. To maximize my F1 visa, I'm planning on having a part-time job in the campus. What jobs are usually available there? 
2. Are the rooms stated in the breakdown of fees/cost automatically the on-campus ones (pertaining to the rooms where you get to live with another stranger)? If so, do they allow visitors? Is there a curfew? Can we just go in and out of the campus whenever we want to? Are there specific things I need to consider?
3. How does the swipe-based meal plan work? Is that prepaid included in the fees/cost itself?

(Formerly known as Asperger’s Syndrome) While I certainly have the skills to live independently, and am on the “highest-functioning” end of the spectrum, it still manifests in some aspects of my life, such as ability to fully comprehend instructions, “reading between the lines”, and sometimes ability to make friends, though this one not as much as in my middle/early high school years. As someone on the spectrum, there are some areas that draw me to ASU, for example, I get the impression that the school isn’t as greek life centered.

wpz2qp,Studio West Apartments (pet),"Alright so I moved into studio west apartments this weekend and I have a dog. I was reading the lease agreement stuff and noticed that they required poo prints registration. When I registered (after moving in) they said I needed to ask the manager about the what is needed.  I looked back at the lease agreement they gave me when I moved in and said that it was needed two weeks before I moved in.

Now, here’s the issue. 5-6 weeks ago I sent my dogs vaccination information and in the email I asked them if there was anything else required before I moved. In the email, they said there was nothing else needed. However, now it is saying if they find out I’m not register before I moved in it could be a $250 fine. 

The manager didn’t bring it up to me when I gave all my information when I moved in. Should I email the manager about what is needed as a reply to the email from a month ago, or should I stay quiet and not contact about the issue. 

PooPrints is usually used to figure out who isn’t picking up the poop and I’m going to keep up with his poop. Management knows I have a dog, given I paid a $300 dog fee and pay $15 a month. He’s also pretty anxious the first 10-30 minutes I leave him. So he whines, howls, and barks. I’m currently trying to help his separation anxiety. So basically, they’d figure out I have a dog. 

Let me know what I should do. This is my first apartment so I’m precautious. I also take things literally and try to follow all the rules but I know sometimes some rules aren’t taken as serious.

wskm56,How to make friends?,"Hello friends, I’ve written on here before and have gotten some good responses so I am here again for another question 

I am a transfer student this year. I have two roommates and although they are very sweet, we are totally different people. They are very close minded and sort of judgey, which I genuinely cannot stand. One of the things they are super judgey about is alcohol. Neither of them are 21, and I’m about to turn 22. I’m not into frat parties and shit like that anymore because I did that for 2 years and I’m just over that but I do enjoy going to breweries, bars, pregaming/ tailgating for football games, things like that. I have bought some wine when I’ve gone grocery shopping and oh man do I get the looks! 

I definitely have other interests than just drinking don’t get me wrong but I do enjoy being out and socializing because I’m a pretty extroverted person. all my roommates want to do is sit at home and watch Netflix which is totally chill from time to time but I’m starting to go stir crazy. 

I am a huge college football fan even before coming to App ( I’m from the Blacksburg, VA area so going to Tech games have been my life since I was a kid) and I really want to go to the football games and stuff but my roommates have zero interest in that. 

How do I make friends here that are into the same things as me?

x2ub3p,Dog with separation anxiety,"Hey, so my senior dog has pretty bad separation anxiety or isolation distress. I’m living in an apartment and my neighbor has already complained about it. I don’t blame them because he howls for almost an hour after I leave and on and off for the second hour. I have to be gone 3 days a week for my grad classes and a club. I’m looking for a job as well so once I find one he’d be alone then too. 

I’m working with him on my own to help with his anxiety. He’s at about a 5 second duration. I give him pet rescue remedy on days I’m going to be leaving as well. It makes me not want to leave my apartment because when I’m here he’s pretty quiet. I’m also going to see if crate training him will help as well. I also walk him 30 minutes before I leave. 

I don’t want to teach him not to bark because I’m a girl living alone, so I want him to bark if someone tries to get in if I’m here or not here. It’s the howling that is the main issue. 

I don’t think I’d be able to afford a trainer because they are pretty expensive. I’m worried if I can’t get him to quiet down then I will have to send him home. I have a history of severe depression and anxiety and he helps me stay focused and in the right mindset.

x3qees,Fire Safety,"Friendly Reminder that fire safety (especially when living in communal housing) is important. A fire in your living space is potentially a fire in everyone's living space. You do not want to be the one responsible for destroying people's possessions, their health or even their life. 


Candles and other open flames are not allowed in the dorms for a reason. If you still choose to keep flammable objects around be smart when you use them. Don't leave candles burning unattended( this includes falling asleep).

When using a microwave please read the instructions on the package for microwaving (not oven, there is a huge difference). Never leave the microwave unattended as this can lead to you missing the signs of food starting to smolder. When in doubt use less time or reduce the cook power.

Everyone should know where the fire extinguisher is on their floor and they should know how to use it. (If you don't look for where it is and read how to operate it.)

Know how to get to the closest exit out of your building. Use the stairs and not the elevators as they may fill up with smoke. 

If there is a fire get out of the building, let others know about the fire and call the fire department or 911.

Fire is no joke it damages property, injuries and kills people. Help prevent fires, don't be part of the problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/x3qees/fire_safety/,John_Linville,1,2022-09-01 22:58:30,0,/r/appstate/comments/x3qees/fire_safety/

xbzjey,Thinking about transferring,"Freshman at Wake Forest. Simply put, this place fucking sucks. Moved three days short of a month ago and I've been miserable ever since. I've put myself out there more than I ever have in my life but nothing is landing. I don't come from the wealthiest of backgrounds, I'm not from the same four cities in the north, not too big into greek life, and didn't go to some private academy for high school like everyone here. I don't feel socially compatible at all--its abundantly clear who's on scholarship and from what I've gathered online people here have had similar issues to myself and winded up transferring. There's nothing to do on campus outside of paying to go to frats, I genuinely feel like I'm written off as a dumb hick from the south in the eyes of most of these people, and the surrounding area is so horrendously designed and unwalkable, and Winston-Salem might actually give Fayettenam a run for its money as the worst city in this state. 

I know the general advice is to stick it out a year but I honestly don't know whether or not I can do that without slipping into depression or worse. I've been looking into other in-state schools because cost is a major factor for me (only going to Wake Forest because I got offered insane financial aid), and App State has caught my eye. I know a couple of people at App State from my high school and was able to get out to Boone for the UNC game (planning to head back for the Troy game) and loved it there. Growing up in the suburbs of Charlotte, I've always been fond of the mountains as it was an escape from uniformity, and I genuinely think I had more positive interactions in Boone in one weekend than I've had in Winston in the past month. I'm not sure why I didn't give it more thought when applying to schools back in October, and I've already begun to look at the transfer application. In general, what's the experience like for transfer students? Obviously it may be harder than non-transfers, but is it significantly harder?

xe9oyv,The new meal plan is starving me,"When the new meal plans came out and when students who live on campus were required to pick one, I had no idea this was what I was choosing. The information on all of these meal plans was not informative enough, and like most students, I was very confused. When it came to it, I ended up eating normally for the first three weeks. Breakfast, something small for lunch, and dinner. For example, a biscuit with something to drink, lunch was maybe a sandwich, and dinner might've been a burger. 

I have no dining dollars left and I'm on the weekly 7 plan which means that if I want to eat everyday, I can only eat ONCE a day.

Most times I'd rather starve myself all day than to give up a chance at a maybe edible dinner. I've started bringing tubs with me to take food back so I'll have something to eat in the morning or for dinner if I go to eat at lunch time. I only have two options of places to eat- and only one of those options has edible food most days. Sometimes the food goes bad or something happens to it before I can eat it. This week I lost my breakfast stash to the floor after hitting my head on some railing.

I hate this. Students shouldn't have to deal with food insecurity. I already know that it's partially my fault for not understanding, but what will happen to the rest of the students who only have $300 PER SEMESTER. What happens when they can't afford to eat more than once a day when exams roll around because maybe they decided they wanted a burrito or chic-fil-a from central every once in a while.

y8jqtx,Help with interest statement,"I'm currently applying to app state and am wondering if I could get any advice on my interest statement. I'm afraid starting off with a mountain quote is to cliche/cheesy. Any feedback is appreciated:

""Every mountain top is within reach if you just keep climbing"" -Barry Finlay. I've been climbing a mountain my whole life, the summit being my future career. Appalachian State has everything I want in a college. Its decadent campus is surrounded by mountains; an aspect very important to me as it's those same mountains where I learned how to be a leader. I directed my friends through those valleys countless times upon learning how to hike. The university is also the perfect size for me. As an Asian American, I wish to enroll in a school with a large and diverse population. I wish to represent those in the Asian community like I have during my high school career. The school also provides opportunities for someone aspiring to major in film. Cinema has been an integral part of my life ever since I was a child and has guided my current highschool life. Whether it be entering film festivals, writing scripts for short plays and movies, or acting in my school's productions, film has defined my path in reaching the so-called summit that is my career. I wish to carry on this journey in film through app state. I feel that calling myself a mountaineer would solidify me rest of my path in climbing my personal mountain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/appstate/comments/y8jqtx/help_with_interest_statement/,Humble-Age2652,1,2022-10-19 20:56:25,0,/r/appstate/comments/y8jqtx/help_with_interest_statement/

If there is anybody in the MBA program (in person or online) have any insight or general comments about it, maybe I can make a decision of whether or not I would be willing to move back to Boone.

How does the university prepare for this, how are the roads, etc.?
