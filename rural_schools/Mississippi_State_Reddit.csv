bpfkdi,Subleasing apartment,"Hey all, assuming these types of posts are ok here (sorry if not!), I've recently landed a job out of state and am looking to sublease out my apartment. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a 1 bed/1.5 bath in Greentree, near the intersection of Louisville Street and Lynn Lane. Pretty recently renovated and in good condition. Ceramic tile floors and the dishwasher/kitchen/oven are pretty new. About 1,000 square feet. Two floors, with the kitchen and living room downstairs and the full bath and bedroom upstairs. It's a quiet place. I've lived in it for six years and haven't had any trouble. This particular unit is not pet-friendly. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is unfurnished. Comes with washing/dryer hookups. There's a laundry place around the corner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much located in the middle of town, so it's easy to get to just about wherever. Takes about 10 minutes to get to campus, depending on traffic. 

&amp;#x200B;

My lease just renewed, so this would run through April. I'll be moving out at the end of June, so July is available for move in. I've got photos of the place and can answer any questions. Just gimme a holler if interested.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/bpfkdi/subleasing_apartment/,SirRugdumph,10,2019-05-16 13:41:07,0,/r/Msstate/comments/bpfkdi/subleasing_apartment/

bsiyo8,Best SEC Games to Go to,"Hey guys, 27m here huge sports fan in Southern California. The sports culture, especially college out here is garbage. I grew up going to all the USC/UCLA (Go Bruins) games but those werent always the best atmospheres. Ive always wanted to live in the south (for a few reasons including college football) for half a year or so and am moving there (either Nashville, Greenville SC, or Birmingham. still deciding where) this August until new years or so.

My plan is to go to the absolute BEST college football games this year every Saturday or so in the south. I will be driving. And it doesnt matter if I have to leave at midnight Friday and come back Sunday. My main sport is NFL (Go Broncos) and I havent followed college football at an intricate level so I want to know not only the best teams to to see live (obviously Bama, Clemson, UGA etc), but the best teams to see them play against. Im sure the atmospheres are completely different bases on if they are die hard rivals or not. Like when I see the Broncos play in Denver the games vs the Chiefs, Raiders, and Pats have such a better atmosphere than playing teams like the bengals, redskins, or rams.

So far I know that seeing the Iron bowl would be a must do (even though tickets are around $300 right now), and LSU at night (also how do you know which games are night games since the times aren't out yet)? Of course seeing UGA is big but what opponent games that they would play would have the best atmosphere? Some people mentioned seeing the Sandman atmosphere at VT too.

Some of the options ive read: Bama, clemson, auburn, tennessee, LSU, Gainsville, UGA, South Carolina, VT, Florida State, Ole Miss, Memphis, A&amp;m (but this is probably out because a bit too far to drive to for the weekend), Arkansas, Arkansas State, Miss state. Any more?

So far ive narrowed down some ones that could be good by date. Im not worried about skipping some weeks or going to just ""average games"" for the sake of my time or wallet.

Here is the 2019 schedule for reference

[http://www.espn.com/college-football/schedule](http://www.espn.com/college-football/schedule)

8/31: Not any huge games it looks like but do any openers have great atmospheres? Someone mentioned **Ole Miss at Memphis** will be a wild one. That Thursday is a night game **GT at Clemson**. Not sure how that will be.

9/7: **A&amp;M at Clemson?** Seems to be the best Clemson game all year.

9/14: **Bama at South Carolina?**

9/21: Coincidentally im probably going to the **Michigan at Wisconsin** game this weekend since ill be in Green Bay for the Broncos Packers game. and yes I know UGA is hosting Notre Dame but cant go to that

9/28: Not sure, any good ones? **Towson Tigers at Florida?** lol jk **Ole Miss at Bama?** Would probably be going to a bigger bama game later in the year but would go twice if its worth it. Someone mentioned **Cincinnati at Marshall and also maybe Clemson at UNC.**

10/5: **Auburn at Florida** at the swamp is a game everyone is recommending. But this could be my only good chance to see the Vols when its **UGA at Tenn.** So not sure.

10/12: Wedding this weekend no games. I know, California.

10/19: I heard about the 3rd Saturday of October when its **Vols at Bama.** But would probably be going to the better LSU at Bama later in the year so not sure if I should go twice. If I dont go it could be a good chance to go to the Grove. **A&amp;M at Ole Miss? LSU at Miss State?** Not sure which one of those would be better.

10/26: **Auburn at LSU** seems to be a lock. Want it to be a night game. Plus Saints play on that sunday.

\---10/31 Someone mentioned if I can go halloween night **GT at App State** would be fun.

11/2: **UGA at Florida?** The cocktail party seems like a blast even though im already going to a game in florida. I know this game is at a nuetral stadium. Someone also mentioned **Miami at Florida State?**

11/9: **LSU at Bama?** Seems like an good one.

11/16: **UGA at Auburn?** I heard that this game is not to be missed. But would already be going to the Auburn game vs Bama 2 weeks later. And if I dont do this one, I would be able to see **LSU at Ole miss** if that is a good one.

11/23: **A&amp;M at UGA?** Plus Falcons play on that sunday.

11/30: **Bama at Auburn?** The Iron bowl.

Im not sure if all this would be realistic but I want to see as many good games as I can.

Also Ill be probably going alone to these games. Any recs on how to kind of blend in/make friends via tailgating when at the game? Any best tailgate spots places to go?

My location in the south would be central so these should be a 8ish hour drive or closer. Also any recommendations on best cities to live in the south? Don't want something too touristy (still want that southern feel) but dont want a pure college atmosphere so that ill stand out if not going to the school. Thanks guys. Also 2 games in one day or weekend is possible im sure but would probably need to wait for the time of the games to be announced.

Are night games much better atmospheres in the same way NFL night games are much better than the day games?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/bsiyo8/best_sec_games_to_go_to/,moneyyman,9,2019-05-24 12:26:18,12,/r/Msstate/comments/bsiyo8/best_sec_games_to_go_to/

bwbo6v,"FYI: We're moving away from Sophos, don't forget to uninstall it from your personal machines","ITS is moving away from Sophos as our endpoint protection of choice, in favor of Cisco AMP. (Advanced Malware Protection)


AMP does not have any personal-use licensing. If you have installed the unmanaged Sophos client on a personal machine via the ITS website, it will stop updating on June 30, which is the end of our contract. Make sure to uninstall Sophos, lest you have an increasingly out-of-date antivirus on your machine.

Removing Sophos will automatically let Defender reactivate on Win8/10, and that's more than enough for an AV solution these days as long as you're practicing good habits and using common sense. If you want to continue using Sophos on Windows or macOS, you can use Sophos Home for free with your own personal-use account:


https://home.sophos.com/en-us.aspx


If you're a GA/student worker/staff, the switch to Cisco AMP will be automated on ITS-managed devices.


Copy/paste of the university announcement:


&gt; From: Steve Parrott, Chief Information Officer¬†

&gt; MSU's current ITS-managed endpoint, anti-virus solution installed on university-inventoried computers is Sophos. Our Sophos license for MSU will expire on June 30, 2019.¬†

&gt; I am pleased to announce that Cisco's Advanced Malware Protection (AMP), which is a next generation anti-virus/anti-malware endpoint solution has been chosen to replace Sophos. During the month of June, we will be installing AMP on all university-owned computers. AMP will give ITS insight and feedback into security threats and malware that we haven't had in the past.¬†

&gt; MSU employees who have installed the home version of Sophos on their personally owned computers from our ITS website need to be aware it will expire on June 30, 2019, as well. Employees are encouraged to uninstall Sophos on their personal computers and choose another no-cost anti-virus solution found in the following ITS Service Desk knowledge-base article:https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=1583¬†.¬†

&gt; If you need additional information, please contact the ITS Service Desk by phone at¬†(662) 325-0631¬†or by email at¬†servicedesk@msstate.edu.¬†",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/bwbo6v/fyi_were_moving_away_from_sophos_dont_forget_to/,meatwad75892,3,2019-06-03 11:03:51,0,/r/Msstate/comments/bwbo6v/fyi_were_moving_away_from_sophos_dont_forget_to/

cmcc4e,Thespis Story Time,"Hidey ho, neighbors.  Welcome to MSU, home of the Bulldogs!  If you‚Äôre an incoming freshman, or a transfer student, I highly recommend that you browse through the information below.  If you‚Äôre new faculty/staff, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt for you to look at some of this as well.  So much has changed in the last year(change is the only constant) that it is hard to keep up with everything.  For a while it was just copy pasta and move along.  Now I have to change and rewrite the information content every year.  The biggest change from last year is (ominous music) The Cloud(Remember kids, The Cloud is just someone else‚Äôs computer)!  Back in January MSU moved our CMS to Canvas, which is hosted in the cloud.  This past year we have also moved away from Microsoft Exchange on site and moved it to Office365, so Faculty/Staff email is now in the cloud.  Don‚Äôt worry, you crazy kids still have Google which has been in The Cloud forever.  Along with that we just recently moved away from Skype for Business, which was on site, to Microsoft Teams.  It‚Äôs hosted in...you guessed it‚Ä¶..The Cloud.  

Disclaimer:  I work for ITS and can answer almost any question you may have about certain things regarding [ITS](https://www.its.msstate.edu/).  That being said, my thoughts and comments are my own, not ITS‚Äô.  For help with setup of devices and other general issues you should contact the [Service Des}(https://servicedesk.msstate.edu).  The highly trained individuals there will get you setup in no time!

**WIRELESS*

**eduroam**
This is a federated service that allows all faculty, staff and students that visit another eduroam institution the ability to connect to their wireless infrastructure.  Connect by using  netid@msstate.edu as the username and your NetPassword for the password.  Not only does it give you access to MSU‚Äôs network, this SSID is offered all over the world and when visiting friends at other universities, you will just connect automatically to their network.  This will be our default 802.1x authenticated wireless option in the near future.  If you are using msu1x, then you should forget that network and start using **eduroam**.

**msu3**
This is NO LONGER HIDDEN!!  I REPEAT!!  MSU3 IS NO LONGER HIDDEN!!!  This SSID is used for getting devices that don't do 802.1x authentication onto the network.  e.g. Xbox, Tivo...  Because we have unhidden the SSID more devices will work.  For example, some ROKUs had a horrible time connecting.  They should work now.  To use this service you must register the MAC Address of the device with us.  Visit http://www.its.msstate.edu/msu3 for more information.  

**msuguest** 
Should be self-explanatory, but I've had many people say they were unaware of this. If you have guests such as your parents, etc on campus that need to get online use this SSID.  DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR NETID/NETPASSWORD!!  If you are Faculty/Staff you can get the daily password at http://www.its.msstate.edu/. It's also written &amp; presented in a few public spots, primarily the Barnes and Noble cafe.  Please do not share your NetID/NetPassword with guests to get them on eduroam.

**msu8**
Nothing to see here, move along!  http://gph.is/1aS6w4e 

**SECURITY**

**Duo**
This ties in with your NetPassword.  It‚Äôs 2 Factor Authentication.  You can use the downloadable app on your smartphone.  We do not offer SMS or phone calls, which are inherently vulnerable to hackers taking over your phone number.  If you use SMS for 2FA anywhere else, turn it off and move to an app or some type of token.  I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre providing hardware tokens to students, but faculty and staff can request one if they don‚Äôt want to use their phone.  Other 2FA tokens, like yubikey, are known to work, but ITS is not currently officially supporting them at this time.   Find more information about Duo here:  http://www.its.msstate.edu/services/accounts/two-factor-authentication/

**NetPassword Maintenance**
It's always a good idea to change your password from time to time.  http://netpassword.msstate.edu/ will allow you to make those changes.  Speaking of passwords, ITS will **NEVER EVER** ask you for your password.  Please don't get phished.  Don't share your password with anyone and if an email requests that you ""update your settings"" it is most likely not from MSU. **DO NOT SHARE YOUR PASSWORD WITH ANYONE**

**VPN**
You may or may not know that you can use the VPN from anywhere in the world to secure your data and information.  This works great where free wifi is offered, but not secured.  You can use the VPN to encrypt everything from prying wireless sniffers.  For connection options visit https://vpn.msstate.edu/

**Copyright Infringement**
First rule of Bittorrent is don‚Äôt do it.  Second rule of Bittorrent is DON‚ÄôT DO IT!  We will find out and you will have to go see the Dean of Students.  RIAA and MPAA send us notifications all the time about students and even Faculty and Staff.  We are required by law to notify you and get you to stop the illegal file sharing.  Students have been sued by RIAA in the past.  Don‚Äôt become a statistic.  Yes, we have a very fast Internet connection, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can illegally share copyrighted material without facing the consequences.  http://filesharing.msstate.edu/ 


**EMAIL**

**BullyMail**
BullyMail is the MSU branded GMail offering to students.  Access to it can be found through the myState portal.  More on that later.  There is additional information located here:  https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/KB/?CategoryID =50

**O365** 
Faculty and Staff have all been migrated to O365 in The Cloud.  Desktop Support should have setup your email client for you.  If not, you can find additional information at:  https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/KB/?CategoryID=93

**Listserv**
ITS provides an email list service.  This service is no longer provided to student organizations.  However, Faculty/Staff can still apply to get a list created.  http://lists.msstate.edu/ is the URL for the service, but if you want to request a list, you have to fill out this form: https://www.its.msstate.edu/files/info_server_mailing_list.pdf  

**AntiSPAM**
Unfortunately the hosted SPAM protection solution known as CanIt has been discontinued with MSU.  MSU now provides Cisco Email Security.  It‚Äôs brand new and we don‚Äôt have a lot added, but here is a decent article on what has changed.  If you have further questions contact the ITS Service Desk.  https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=1598


**CLASSROOM**

**Canvas**
Canvas is the latest and greatest Course Management System.  Almost all of your classes will have content in Canvas.  Use the myState portal or go to https://canvas.msstate.edu

**Attendance Tracking**
This is a big initiative from the highest authority.  Studies show that college students who attend class do better and tend to graduate at higher rates.  I‚Äôm sure everyone has heard Dr. Keanum say ‚ÄúGo to class‚Äù.  He‚Äôs not kidding.  All freshmen classes are required to take attendance.  They use standard card readers in most of the freshmen classes.  There may be a few that take role manually, but those are the exceptions.  You can find more information here: https://www.its.msstate.edu/support/documentation/attendance/ 

**ID Card Test Stations**
ID card test stations are available to ensure that the electronics embedded in the ID card are in good working condition. The excuse of ‚ÄúMy card didn‚Äôt work‚Äù will not get you out of an absense(unless the reader is what is actually messed up).  To this end, we provide test stations around campus to test your card.  Test stations are available at the following Starkville campus locations:

* Allen Hall lobby outside the ITS Service Desk(Room 108 in the lobby)
* Mitchell Memorial Library inside the entrance to the Computer Commons
* The Union ground floor near the south entrance to the Food Court
* The Sanderson Center lobby
 
**myState**
This is the MSU ‚ÄúPortal‚Äù.  It gets you to Banner, Canvas, Email and other services.  It‚Äôs a one stop shop if you will.  Visit https://my.msstate.edu


**MISC*

**Software Offered**
You should be able to download free software that's available to Faculty, Staff and Students as well.  Not everything listed here is for students, but most is available for you.

Free latest versions of Office for active students/employees thanks to the Student &amp; Teacher Advantage program on up to 5 machines. Jump through the hoops at https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/Requests/ServiceCatalog?CategoryID=1091 (Which is encouraged because it explains the terms of the program... But ultimately, you're just entering netid@msstate.edu at login.microsoftonline.com and letting it redirect you to the MSU login page) You can also sign into the Android/iOS Office apps with netid@msstate.edu in lieu of a personal MS account, and it doesn't tie up one of your 5 Office licenses... Those are just for the full Office suite on Windows/OS X.

I've been here for a couple years and yet I've gone out to the bars only a single time with a few friends. I've always spent my free time relaxing with my girlfriend, studying for exams, or doing one of my hobbies. She graduated last May and got a job on the coast, so I'm on my own until I graduate next spring. With her gone, I realized that I've majorly neglected my social life.
  
  
Embarrassingly, I've yet to make one friend who I would say is close. Well, I had a few pals, but they graduated as well. The others are mere acquaintances who I only hang out with during study time. I sometimes look out my window and see all you Cotton District fuckers having such a good time! So jealous üò´
  
  
With all that said, should I step outside and just take a seat at the bar at Bin-612 or something? I don't want to seem like a lonely weirdo or something. I just want to make myself uncomfortable and see if maybe I can end up having a good conversation with someone. Or just get drunk and get loose. I'm freaking clueless on how to socialize.

d3xs5d,A funny story about how inept Moe‚Äôs is,"Hello all, figured this story may give you a laugh.

So the founders at Moe‚Äôs are notoriously assholes. I‚Äôve been many times and never had a problem until last night. 

Little backstory: I‚Äôve heard too many horror stories about Starkville substance control. I take no risk, especially not by drinking at a bar. I‚Äôm also a straight arrow, never even touched weed. An occasional cigar is the only ‚Äúdrug‚Äù product I indulge in. 

So I‚Äôm underage and my buddy C is not. The drill as Moe‚Äôs is overage gets a wristband, underage gets X‚Äôs with a marker on your hand. The drink staff won‚Äôt serve you unless you have a wristband, so the X‚Äôs are really kinda pointless and 90% of the time they rub or sweat off anyway. 

We go to Moe‚Äôs, I have X‚Äôs on my hands. I go the bathroom and wash my hands well as I always do. The X‚Äôs naturally fade a tad, I shrug it off as they don‚Äôt matter anyway. I go to the bar and grab a Pepsi and sit back down.

Along comes some little short, husky, blonde bouncer who I can almost literally see him puffing his chest. Dude approaches me:

‚ÄúYou gotta leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drinking you gotta leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúDude it‚Äôs a Pepsi.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not you gotta leave.‚Äù

*push Pepsi to him* ‚Äútry it. It‚Äôs a Pepsi.‚Äù

Little man takes a drink and I literally see his eyes get wide like *oh shit.* I suppose being wrong hurts his ego though.

‚ÄúWell you washed off your X‚Äôs you have to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúI went to the bathroom and washed my hands.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah you intentionally washed them off. ‚Äú

‚ÄúCan I buy a drink without a wristband?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why do they matter?‚Äù

**He stops for a second. Busted. Lol.**

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care you gotta leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúHold up, so you‚Äôre suggesting I intentionally washed off my X‚Äôs, which don‚Äôt matter anyway, and then went and bought a Pepsi.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just gotta leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get remarked?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo you have to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever, alright man have a good one.‚Äù

So I get up to leave and my faithful buddies come with me. Little man went so above and beyond to follow us outside and specifically tell the bouncers not to let me back in. At this point this is ridiculous. He is obviously just trying to swing his dick around.

We walk off a little pissed and C convinced me it‚Äôs worth at least asking about it. So we head back and plead my case to the bouncers and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúnah I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt come in.‚Äù I wish them a good night and walk off. 

This is where things get great. C is a slightly more abrasive drunk, so he stays back and keeps arguing. Eventually little blonde asshole comes back outside and argues with C. C tells him correctly that I was kicked out for drinking a Pepsi to which blonde bitch says:

‚Äú*Your friend was doing coke in the bathroom.*‚Äù

At this point C loses it. Not only were we kicked out at 10 PM for a dumb reason, but now the kid responsible is bold-facing lying his way out of it. 

‚ÄúARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? HE‚ÄôS NEVER DONE A DRUG IN HIS LIFE. FUCK MOE‚ÄôS THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT AND YOU FUCKING KNOW IT.‚Äù

C is absolutely going apeshit (an amazing friend.) All of downtown can hear him. This little blonde bitch is physically shrinking. I walk back over and make C leave and apologize to the bouncers trying really hard not to crack up laughing. 

At this point a cop conveniently comes by. He pulls over and I go talk to him.

‚ÄúWe got a problem guys?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm not really. I got kicked out of Moe‚Äôs for drinking a soda.‚Äù

‚ÄúDrinking a soda?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Ya know how they put X‚Äôs on your hands?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I went to the bathroom and they washed off. Then I got a Pepsi and some bouncer kid thought I was drinking and kicked me out.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you have a wristband?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo the X‚Äôs don‚Äôt matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you were drinking a soda?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. ‚Äú

‚Äú...that is fucking stupid. Sorry guys, just don‚Äôt let him fight anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got it sir, have a good one.‚Äù

So I walked home and prayed that the bouncers don‚Äôt recognize me next week. I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt, if anything they‚Äôll remember C. 

And that, my friends, is how I became the kid who did coke in the Moe‚Äôs bathroom for drinking a soda.

dutq2o,Capitalizing on Mississippians irrational fear of the cold,"Okay guys, listen up. I'm an ice-baby from the Great White North, and I know a potential snow day when I see one. So, in this post, I've included a few steps we can do to secure classes being cancelled tomorrow.

1) It's finna rain all night, then drop below freezing around 1 AM. Down here in the South, if it's below freezing, y'all start to freak out a little already. We can upgrade that anxiety into a full blown panic if we play our cards right. Add the freezing temps with water already on the roads (which definitely won't freeze over cuz the ground is too warm), just might be enough to make everyone panic and cancel class. Make sure to tell *everyone* you see today that the cold is BAD AND DANGEROUS, and that water on the roads can FREEZE INSTANTLY (lying is worth not having class).

2) Right now in the iPhone weather app, there's a snowflake symbol around 3 AM. To ensure class gets cancelled, we need to screenshot this and spread it around. The snowflake is somehow worse than a pentagram to you Southern Protestants, so we need to make sure everyone sees this. Print it out, hand it out in class, hack the projector in your classroom and show the weather--whatever it takes. We need to participate in some good ol' classic fear-mongering over snow.

3) To really get people going, start lying some salt on the steps around campus, even if it's table salt. Nobody has any idea how to deal with ice down here, but salt seems to be the initial go-to. That'll really get people believing that ice is coming.

4) Finally, I'm gonna need about 5 people to come with me to Dr. Keenum's house tonight around midnight and use a hose to spray down his driveway. This is a classic trick up north--ice the superintendent's driveway so they think it's this bad all over town. This should seal the deal.

I don't wanna go to class tomorrow so let's make it happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/dutq2o/capitalizing_on_mississippians_irrational_fear_of/,Fireblade09,1,2019-11-11 10:15:29,25,/r/Msstate/comments/dutq2o/capitalizing_on_mississippians_irrational_fear_of/

eho22b,"Joe Moorhead isn‚Äôt going to be (and shouldn‚Äôt be) fired, no matter today‚Äôs outcome.","I know this isn‚Äôt always the most popular take among the Maroon and White faithful, but how about we let fans of TSUN and the new troll they put in charge of their football program talk trash about our coach and players, and we talk trash about teams that don‚Äôt play for Mississippi State University. Honesty is important, and when mistakes are made, they should be addressed, but calling for Moorhead‚Äôs job after two (albeit underwhelming) seasons is ridiculous. 

MS State fans are always trying to replace their coach. [Alabama Sports Hall of Fame Coach Sylvester Croom] (https://247sports.com/college/alabama/Article/New-inductees-into-the-2020-Alabama-Sports-Hall-of-Fame-include-former-Alabama-player-and-coach-Sylvester-Croom-former-Tide-assistant-Woody-McCorvey-and-officials-administrato-139828009/) won [SEC coach of the year in 2007] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference_football_individual_awards?wprov=sfti1) and was pushed to [resign in 2008] (https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2008/11/29/Mississippi-State-football-coach-resigns/66731228012449/). Even in light of being the most recent MSU coach to beat Alabama, Croom still goes under appreciated by many Bulldog fans, but the [improvements he made to our program] (https://www.espn.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/51335/looking-back-sylvester-croom-was-the-perfect-choice) outlived his tenure in Starkville. 

Then we got Dan the Man, the mirror Coach Moorhead is asked to look into every morning. While at MSU, Dan went 33-39 (45.8%) in the SEC. Of SEC teams he saw more than once, he only had a winning record against Arkansas (5-4), TSUN (5-4), Kentucky (8-1), and Vandy (2-0). He consistently struggled against Auburn (3-6), LSU (2-7), and, of course, Alabama (0-[Clock] (https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2013/11/2/5058664/mississippi-state-south-carolina-clock-management-dan-mullen) [management] (https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mullen-shoulders-the-blame-for-clock-management-miscue-against-lsu) seemed to be an Achilles Heel for Mullen‚Äôs Bulldogs. Then there was the [South Alabama game] (https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/dan-mullen-the-shorts-the-smirk-and-the-postgame-comments-090516), which may be the darkest shadow on Dan Mullen‚Äôs time in Maroon and White. Even the Herculean task of Mississippi State‚Äôs premier as the country‚Äôs highest rated football team was marred by upsets from Bama, and TSUN, as well as an Orange Bowl loss to Georgia Tech. 

Like any MSU head coach, Dan saw his share of fans calling for his [dismissal] (https://www.teamspeedkills.com/2013/10/24/5024720/fire-dan-mullen-mississippi-state-hot-seat). There was even talk that Dan might be [fired] (https://www.forwhomthecowbelltolls.com/2016/10/24/13380304/cost-benefit-analysis-of-keeping-and-firing-dan-mullen) [before his final season] (https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/buy-or-sell-should-dan-mullen-be-fired-102416). 

Last year, Moorhead was forced to work with tools built for someone else‚Äôs offensive system, and he had to confront the adjustments that come along with your first major gig as an HC. This year, we‚Äôve been plagued with injuries and scandal. Excuses don‚Äôt win football games, but we need to be fair when we judge our team. 

Everyone wants a 10 win season, but no one has any idea who to hire to get there. We could have hired anyone in the country when Dan left, and we got the guy we wanted. All we can do now is build a supportive environment where the new staff has a chance to enact their vision of our program.

Any SEC West program is the toughest coaching job in the country. We don‚Äôt need to make it harder on our own coach. Hopefully this cycle of running coaches off ends soon.

Obviously you‚Äôre entitled to your own opinion, but I‚Äôm proud to say Joe Moorhead is my football coach and Mississippi State is my football team.

eirake,There are literally no redeemable factors about Moorhead. So here's my coach wishlist,"He vastly underachieves, the discipline of this team is complete shit. At least Croom had a clean ship and at least Mullen was successfully. I literally cannot fathom any reason people want to stick it out with Moorhead. 

Seriously, Croom sucked but at least there was some decency. In JoMo's 2 year tenure we've already had a cheating scandal (of which there were no repercussions) and a fight that injured QB1 that went public.

I'm just going to keep it real, he is a terrible leader. You have players fighting fans on twitter, underwhelming game results, downright stupid in-game play calling and decisions, and every week there seems to be another off-the-field issue. 

I hate when people say he needs to bring in his own guys because he had a cabinet full of talent left behind by Mullen. I mean fuck Dan Mullen and all, but he left a treasure chest of a program behind and Moorhead took said chest, threw it out the window, got a loan, and then gambled away the loan money.

Yall understand we are a dog-pissing gesture away from being 5-7 right? There's no reason to keep him. If he isn't fired before the end of next season, then he will have effectively destroyed everything Mullen built and we will once again be the most irrelevant program in this conference.

Hell, give me Moorhead's Year 1 roster and I'm going 9-3 at absolute worst. This year, anyone with a brain could have made it to 8 wins. 

Who to replace him? Glad you asked, I have 5 names that would be home-run hires and easy to snag. At State it is crucial to be able to do more with less, and while JoMo is doing less with Moor, these 5 have proven track records of getting the most and some more out of their programs. 

1. Gus Malzahn 
2. Bob Stoops 
3. Dave Clawson (this is my favorite)
4. Bronco Mendenhall

Now this guy is on nobody's radar so it's only in my perfect world that he would get hired, but I wanted to put the name here, again, just so it could possibly get floated around. 

WF was a dumpster dweller for decades before Clawson took over and now they're seeing better seasons then we are! Note that he is doing this: yes in an easier conference, but with lesser recruits, smallest school in FBS, a wider talent gap in their divison compared to ours in the SEC West.

Please read up on this guy. He takes time to build, but boy when he does, he has it going. Here's his wikipedia page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Clawson

Now his W-L record is not the sexiest, but remember, he's doing this at WAKE FOREST. His results are unprecedented for them. 4 straight bowl games at Wake would be like us going to the NY6 4 seasons in a row, in terms of how huge it is for a program like them. 30-22 over 4 seasons is their best stretch in school history by a mile.

This is the guy. I'm telling you. He has Dan Mullen caliber. Hell, you get me drunk enough and I'll tell ya he can surpass what Mullen did.

That said, do not buy into the bullshit that these students living off of loans and blowing their money are actually high class traders living large as a result of amazing investment skills they just so desperately want to share with you. In reality, they are blowing their money and are taking advantage of susceptible students that they actually befriend in order to later send referral links too, invite them to meetings that benefit you *for just a small fee*, and ultimately inducting you into a pyramid scheme of toxic people that are all being lied too in some way or another.

etne0p,A comprehensive list of Starkville Bars,"Just as Thespis posts his annual IT information, I figured it‚Äôs time to put my minor alcoholism to use and compile a list of all the bars. Correct me on anything and I‚Äôll edit accordingly.

*****************************************

**18+**

Moe‚Äôs: one of the true actual *dance* clubs (and by that I mean...well grinding and mobbing mainly). Closes at around 8 as a restaurant and becomes a bar. Usually gets pretty full on Fridays &amp; Saturday‚Äôs (and on occasion thursdays) Throughout the week they‚Äôll have other events like a bingo. Sometimes the atmosphere is better than others, depending on the DJ. It‚Äôs probably the least ‚Äúcountry‚Äù place in Starkville, favorite of drunk sorority girls and douchey city guys. Drinks are shit and cheap, so get trashed before going. Bouncers used to be dicks but now they‚Äôre pretty cool. Don‚Äôt try drinking though if you don‚Äôt have a fake or are underage‚Äîthey‚Äôre good and will kick you out. I‚Äôd suggest getting there around 10 PM. Cover starts at $10 for under and free for over. Once a line gathers around 10:30-11, cover will jump to $20 for under and $10 for over. Find it downtown on Main Street.

Hobies: a bit more of a country vibe than Moe‚Äôs. Recently expanded so there‚Äôs usually not a line to get in. It expanded into two parts: a bar upstairs and a club downstairs, one cover to get into either. The bar upstairs will have cornhole and live music, the club downstairs will usually have a DJ. Not a ton of dancing (the downstairs might fill up sometimes), but very rarely gets as full as Moe‚Äôs. No real drinks, last I checked they only serve beer. Cover for under starts at $5 and will go up to $10 sometimes, over is always free. Find it down the street from Moe‚Äôs, with plenty of insecure country boys puffing their chests outside. 

Rick‚Äôs: probably the most true ‚Äúbar‚Äù in Starkville. Cover ranges depending on the event‚Äîyou can find anything from live music to midget wrestling, just gotta check online. It‚Äôs usually a pretty laid back scene, you can play pool, flirt a little bit, drinks are decent enough. Pretty much any dress style goes, it‚Äôs a chill bar. Find it on 182.

Dave‚Äôs: kinda like Rick‚Äôs but less large. You‚Äôll walk in and think ‚Äúholy shit this place is shit.‚Äù But in actuality it‚Äôs alright. Food is amazing (deep dish pizza is worth the $$), drinks are alright, sometimes live music, trivia on Thursday‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a good place to bring some friends and chill in a booth. Over is free and under is $5 starting at 8 (?) but they won‚Äôt kick you out if you get there earlier. Find it next to Ricks. 

Cowbells: the place you go when you want to get fucking stabbed. Don‚Äôt go here. It‚Äôs outside city limits, so it stays open till 3, and is normally full of trashy white dudes and completely hammered people who refused to go home after the Starkville bars all close at 1. I‚Äôve never heard a single good thing about cowbells. It‚Äôs sports bar-esque, sometimes there‚Äôs a little dancing. Drinks are shit, cover ranges from $5-$20 for under and free for over. I hope you like cigarettes, because you‚Äôll taste one for days after just stepping foot in.

*21+ ONLY*

The Bin: a very laid back kind of bar. Drinks are alright, the bar food is pretty good, outside patio to go chill on, darts inside. It usually gets pretty full on the weekends (especially on game days), and a more mature vibe. No cover last I checked. Find it in The Cotton District. Just don‚Äôt go during a tornado.

Klassroom, Tiki Bar, 2 Brothers: Bin‚Äôs younger, smaller brothers. Grouped together because they‚Äôre all about the same. Smaller, bar stools, alright drinks. Usually people kinda circulate among the three. 2 Brothers is open during the day for some fantastic BBQ. Also no cover. Find scattered about the cotton district. 

Stagger In: a bit of a dive bar, hole in the wall, sports bar type place. Great place to catch a game and the food is quite underrated. Also, I think they still do thirsty Thursdays, which is like $10 all you can drink or something ridiculous like that. No cover, find up the road from the Bin. 

The Guest Room: the most exclusive spot in Starkville. It‚Äôs an imitation speakeasy hidden in an alley downtown. Very small, very classy, very pricey, very delicious drinks. Find plenty of professors and people of culture wandering around. Hard to get in if you show up late, like I said, it‚Äôs small. Find it down an alley that you feel like you might get mugged walking down (but you won‚Äôt.) 

**Resturants**

Tyler‚Äôs, Bulldog Burger, Mugshots, Harvey‚Äôs: these are all restaurants with sit in bars. Pretty normal stuff, except I know Tyler‚Äôs is a bit classier and stays open a tad later.

I work a job part time during school, full time during winter and summer breaks.  So I am able to personally afford the taxes that come with this since I am the beneficiary of a 529 plan.  Parents pay for the education.. a blessed deal on my part.

But my real question is what do the privileged college students (you know who I'm talking about), or the average college student who couldn't care less about the real world do with this form(s)? Do they cast it aside? Do their parents pick it up? What's the deal?

I was told he'd be available today, and I'm not saying he's like avoiding me or anything, but if you're gonna keep telling people to come by and chat, you need to be available. 

It's become everso obvious that the tensions between SA and the students are higher than ever before and for the first time since I've been here, people are starting to monitor their decision making, and they don't like it. In my opinion, SA needs major reform, or otherwise, things are not going to improve. 

That being said, keep doing what yall are doing. Hold them accountable, monitor what they do. Look, I'm going to be honest with you all, I am indeed Greek, but I agree that the non-Greek populus has a disproportionate representation in the SA and are at a disadvantage in elections. I want to do what I can to try and fix that. Meanwhile, keep this same energy.

Mr. Manning, if you come across this post, I've tried dude. The ball's in your court. Schedule an appointment, something, anything. Or otherwise SA is going to be more and more scrutinized.

To be able to pass the class (due to the ridiculous syllabus) is going to take literally everything I have and I'm not so sure I can do that. But that's not the worst part.

The problem I have is that I am currently at 15 credit hours. I was thinking about taking a W in this course so I don't fail(which is 3 credit hours) but if I do that I'm pretty sure that means I am going to lose my state financial aid for next semester because according to MS financial aid "" If you withdraw or your enrollment drops any time after state aid has been disbursed, then your aid will be canceled for the following term. "". But if I stay in the course and fail I also don't meet the requirements of state aid. So my question is there anything I could do to not lose my financial aid next semester? I don't think it's possible for me to somehow enroll in a different course this late into the semester to take up the remaining hours I need. I'm in trouble here and I don't really have any options I have no family to help me out of the situation so I'm really banking on keeping my financial aid to put me through college.

However, I really love and enjoy math, it is my favorite subject in school (besides music of course). I am currently in AP Calculus AB, and even though I am not the best student in the class, I love to study it and learn more about it, more than any other subject at school.

So my slew of questions are: what is the MSU math major/minor like, what kind of assignments can one expect with the major, what are the tests like, what are the best professors to take, how helpful is the faculty, how much help can I expect outside of class, and is it at all feasible to double major in math and music and graduate within a 4-6 year period?

ff1fbt,This sub has convinced me to get involved in SA next year.,"Hi guys!

I‚Äôm a transfer student who is going to start in the College if Forest Resources during the Fall 2020 semester. I‚Äôve been lurking on this sub the past few days and have read a lot about the major disconnect between the Greek-life influenced SA and the Student body. 

I am currently heavily involved in student government at my local community college, serving on several committees and currently Vice President of our SGA. I really wanted to get involved in something like the Student Senate once I‚Äôm at MSU, because fundamentally I love serving and being the voice of the student body. But I‚Äôve been on the fence about it, due to how dominate Greek life seems to be in SA.

But reading y‚Äôalls posts.. it seems like there is a desire for a non-Greek individual in SA. So.. I guess I‚Äôll be making an attempt this Fall. The odds seem very stacked against me, but that will probably just encourage me to campaign twice as hard.

If anyone has any information about how I can get involved in SA during the Fall (like what positions I can run/apply for, etc) and any general information or advice, I would heavily appreciate it.

Also, if you are also a non-greek life student interested in SA, DM me so we can help eachother out!

Thank y‚Äôall!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/ff1fbt/this_sub_has_convinced_me_to_get_involved_in_sa/,Q_For_SA,1,2020-03-07 15:58:25,4,/r/Msstate/comments/ff1fbt/this_sub_has_convinced_me_to_get_involved_in_sa/

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,  
 **The Savior Messiah Mahdi Maitreya Anyname**

Next, these refunds should be applied to commuters automatically instead of manually.

I was wondering what you thought about the cops wearing face shields (clear) and gloves, to prevent unnecessary spread of the virus during interactions with the public.

hmvgu3,Advice about changing STEM major?,"I‚Äôm a first-year, biochem major with a concentration in forensic science. I have a huge passion for chemistry, biology, and DNA. The more and more I learn about molecular biology, the more and more I want to switch my concentration from FSci to science and pursue a doctoral degree. Much of this has to do with money and wanting to provide for my family.

The only thing is, I‚Äôm not sure how well I‚Äôll be able to handle the workload. My passion can only carry me so far‚Äî I will need to be very diligent in school so I can get into a good grad program, etc.. so far my plan is to wait until November, take a good look at my academic habits, challenges, and grades, and make a decision with my advisor if I still want to.

The district is so packed there are lines out the doors and people are crammed in there so heavily it reminds me of the Bulldog Bash crowd on a smaller scale :-)

hv7v0q,MSU asks all students to self-quarantine for two weeks before returning to classes in Starkville,"From an e-mail from the university (emphasis added by me)


We are in constant consultation with medical experts as we continue to plan for the fall semester.  Recently we had the opportunity to visit with Dr. Thomas Dobbs from the MS Department of Health, and Dr. Allen Sills, an MSU alum who is the Chief Medical Officer for the National Football League.  A few take-aways from those conversations:

* We must view this through the lens of a long-term strategy, not just for the fall.  The statement that struck me the most is that we must learn how to co-exist with COVID-19. Hoping for a vaccine is not a plan, it‚Äôs a wish.  This can markedly change our thought process and strategy if we are thinking beyond just the start of the fall semester.

* We should be focused on risk mitigation, not risk elimination. For all the reasons mentioned in last week‚Äôs message, it is very important for our students to have a combination of a safe and healthy environment, but in the context of an on-campus experience.

* We should strongly encourage our incoming students to self-quarantine for two weeks prior to coming to Starkville and campus.  This can greatly reduce the number of infected individuals who bring the virus to campus initially.  As a result of this recommendation, Regina Hyatt sent the following message out to all students late last week.

**Importantly, for all students who plan to return to campus this fall, we are asking you to self-quarantine at your home for the 2 weeks immediately prior to your move to campus and/or Starkville.** This recommendation comes from our Mississippi Department of Health Director, Dr. Thomas Dobbs. If you will self-quarantine for this period, it will greatly reduce the possibility of your being infected with COVID-19 and therefore, reduce the possibility of your spreading it to your fellow students. We understand this is a big request but ask that you please do this to help ensure our ability to have a safe return to campus.

* By far the most important efforts we should promote:

+ Sick people need to stay home!  This points to why we are doing daily screens, and are making sure that students know that it is ok to miss class and watch online when they have any symptoms at all.  For the foreseeable future, we must assume precaution for any COVID-19 symptom and self-quarantine if anyone, employee or student, experiences any one of the symptoms.

+ Face coverings are critical.  We now have clear medical evidence of the importance of face coverings, and will be emphasizing them as strongly as possible.

+ Ventilation is important.  As a result, we have revisited all ventilation systems to maximize airflow, ensure filtering systems are working at their best, and installing UV light sterilization systems in as many of them as possible.

* Dr. Dobbs suggested we think about a 2 week online-only/self-isolation in response to a COVID outbreak on campus versus moving completely online for the rest of the semester.

Our entire team is tirelessly gathering information so that we can make the best plans possible for the fall and beyond.  We appreciate the countless hours so many of our faculty and staff are spending in ensuring the safest return possible for our students.

Stay Healthy, and Hail State!

hwhmxr,A Comprehensive Guide to Online,"Hi everyone, your friendly neighborhood Bulldog here. I've been seeing several questions lately concerning online classes &amp; procedure, and while I'm not technically affiliated with the university (therefore do not take *any* of this as law), I do work on campus and am fairly well informed. Hopefully this can help clear up some of your questions.

**Methods / Academics**

Guess what, it's past July 20th. Therefore, according to original plans and dates, all classes have been decided and updated on delivery method. This is still subject to change, so check your schedules often! (Banner-&gt;MyBanner for Students-&gt;Academic Records-&gt;View  Class Schedule &amp; Grades). You'll notice a new column named ""Method""--that is the key for how that specific class will happen.

F -- Face to Face. Normal(ish) class. More on that below.

O -- Non-synchronous Online. You will not have a specific time to log in. Assignments and pre-recorded lectures / notes can be viewed at your leisure (and before the due date!)

Z -- Synchronous Online. This *does* have a specific Webex / Zoom time.
 
Q -- HyFlex. This is the most common. Essentially this means a combination of online and face-to-face *for all students*. What this will likely be is come to class once a week with the rest online, but every class may differ.

Above all else--check your syllabus and email your professors! We're all working through this together, communication is crucial. 

The academic schedule has changed slightly. There will be no fall break and classes officially end on November 16th. This will hopefully prevent being in class during the (supposed) most dangerous time.

Like many of you, I considered taking a semester off so that I might enjoy my full college experience. Scholarships is not offering deferment at this time, they need the tuition money. It sucks for everyone, but that's just the way it is. So, DO NOT temporarily drop out of the university without specifically asking financial aid and your advisor first!!! You stand to lose your scholarships and may not get them back--you would have to ask a review board upon re-enrollment and, for better or for worse, I highly doubt administration would think highly of you and be generous in giving them back. I have no idea how or if this will change or even what discussions are being had. There are obviously other possibilities--internships, co-ops, study abroad, graduate school: I don't know the availability of these but they could be a way to delay your student experience until this all passes. Talk to your advisor.
 
**Emergency / Individual Scenarios**

There is, in fact, an option to go all online if you are a student with a health-risk / feel uncomfortable returning to campus / can't leave your state  / whatever. This will be handled and arranged on a case-by-case basis, but if this applies to you, contact your advisor. All classrooms are being equipped with video and audio streaming equipment for this reason. A bit of advice from a senior, though, *don't be lazy.* If you want to go all online simply so you can sleep in, you will set a very poor precedent for yourself, as well as losing out on getting to know your professors / classmates, letters of rec., higher quality education, etc.

Everyone is also very concerned about potential outbreaks. We have no way of knowing if this will or will not happen. The obvious contingency plan is to go back online. There's also talk of, if there's a significant breakout, going online for 2-3 weeks so that campus can hopefully return after people have recovered. This will all be subject to change and depend on context.

Financial aid: we're all broke college students. Thanks to COVID we are now broker college students. The university has some emergency funds available. Book voucher funds can be applied for at student.msstate.edu. Any other COVID-related requests can be made to tsl57@msstate.edu. If you're asking for rent / lost wages, probably out of luck. Don't abuse this.

**Student Life**

It's going to be a very different year to say the least.

Let's start with classroom procedure: classrooms will be spaced so that students can observe appropriate social distancing between themselves. This is going to cause some odd places for class: Sanderson, the Hump, possibly outside in tents--it's all a fight for square footage. Everyone will also be required to wear a mask at all times. Sanitization wipes will be used and available before every class. Sanitizers will be everywhere: use them.

The Student Health Center is still taking appointments and has very fast testing (I got my results back in 29 hours.) The SHC is also *free for students* (except for medication, tests, etc.) Take advantage of this universal healthcare before getting to the real world--if you have COVID symptoms, please go get checked. The Counseling Center (another incredible resource) will be operating, although likely online. Your mental health is important, especially in very stressful times like these!

Masks will be required in dorms unless you are in your room. Everywhere else mask up. Dining halls will be streamlined and mostly to-go. Not sure about on-campus restaurants.

Let's say you do test COVID positive: the university is creating designated quarantine spaces in spare buildings and dorms that you will be moved to and taken care of. Drink plenty of fluids, go live on Instagram, whatevs, just get better and don't get anyone else sick!

Students are being asked to self-quarantine for two weeks before returning to MSU. The feasibility of this is...doubtful, at least. I get it, I also am working / seeing family / etc. Just be conscious of this and avoid any ""Pass the Corona parties"" (if I find out any of you fuckers are doing this I am personally going to come beat your ass while wearing you a mask.) 

Avoid parties / bars. I know it stinks. I'm human too, we all are. I am likely going to cave and end up at a get together at some point or another. Just try to avoid it best you can and be responsible while there.

Sanderson Center is allowing workouts with masks and socially spaced. Last I checked you need to reserve a workout time here: play.urec.msstate.edu. Bring your own water bottle, bring your student ID, you'll be screened upon entry. No pick up basketball at this time, not even shooting around on your own (I am particularly heartbroken about this.) It is important to stay active though! Starkville has several public parks with decent outdoor rims and workout availability. See here: https://www.cityofstarkville.org/270/Parks-and-Recreation

Cheating is going to prominent, technology allows for that. *Don't do it*. It's immoral, you will be unqualified for your job, and the university has more ways than you know to see if you do it. Nothing you do online is non traceable, so opening up a second canvas tab to view your notes might just create a time stamp that professors can might just check and might just notice that it was during your test. Seriously. Don't do it. 

If something seems unfair, respectfully reach out to SA. I'm a Senator, feel free to message me. We're here to represent you.

Things are going to change. Check your email often and plan ahead. Think specifically about leases, working, unemployment, graduate school, gap years.

**Athletics / Events / Clubs**

Currently, fuckall. 

Teams *are* practicing and anticipating a season. Stadium capacities, student section, amount of games, all unknowns right now. But hey we do get a sweet new electronic ticket system.

Bulldog Bash is likely a no-go, although I don't think official word has been dropped yet.

Rush is going to be online. I'm not part of the elite Greeks so I dunno what this means. I highly doubt date parties and some of the other big events will happen though.

Shameless plug: The Streetcar (MSU's Creative Arts Journal) is still going to be meeting and creating a journal. Fuel that quarantine boredom into something artistic for us to review. https://www.thestreetcarmsu.com

**Starkville**

Starkville currently has a mandatory mask resolution. This means that inside businesses you *must* wear a mask. 

Don't worry though, you can still get that amazing Southern food. Restaurants are operating, but you must mask whenever not at your table. Consider eating outside: Bin 612, Bulldog Burger, Mugshots, Two Bros etc. all have open air seating and Mississippi in the fall is beautiful. Most restaurants close at 9 and some of the bars stay open till 12. Drive throughs are open, no dining available at fast food places. Please do support local businesses if you can--they need it, so treat yourself to those Little Dooey ribs (and tip your takeout waiters! They've lost out on a lot lately.) 

Both Walmarts are open and I believe close at 8:30. Consider contactless delivery through their app. If you get the munchies at 2 AM, the only thing open that late is Cookout and the Sprint Mart on 12 across from CVS. Cookout till 3 and Sprint Mart, WaHo, and McD‚Äôs 24 hours

Feel free to direct questions to our Mayor Lynn Spruill. She's an incredible lady and very active on Twitter @lynn_spruill. *Just be polite*. 

**Technology**

Going online is likely going to require some new software additions to your computer. Please, *please* don't download anything that doesn't come from https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/45/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=1210 Testing services (like Honorlock, Secure Browser, etc.) gain access to certain capabilities of your computer, like webcams, keystrokes, microphone, etc. As such, it is very common for viruses to pose as these softwares. If you're not sure, check with ITS or your professor, and make sure to install an antivirus (MSU offers some for free, Malwarebytes is free). Through MSU you can also find Microsoft Office, Webex, and a bunch of other handy softwares for the upcoming school year.

There are going to be software glitches. Let your professors know EARLY and test the software out before the test.

The library is also offering rentable equipment. Please take advantage of this if need be. https://msstate.libcal.com/reserve/dmc

For online class, you might also need a decent webcam and microphone, if your laptop doesn't come with one for whatever reason. Here is what I use: https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Microphone-Computer-Streaming-Superior/dp/B085STB7FR/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=webcam&amp;qid=1595517668&amp;sr=8-4 https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-Condenser-Microphone-Cardioid/dp/B014PYGTUQ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=blue+snowball&amp;qid=1595517705&amp;sr=8-2
Also please consider getting yourself a decent desk setup and a devoted study space. Don't let COVID mess up your back along with your life!

**My Own Musings**

This sucks. There's no if, ands, ors, or buts about it. But let's not allow COVID to sour our opinions towards Mississippi State or to each other. We're all struggling together, and that's okay. While this is not the student experience we hoped for, there may be silver linings to be found here and there. Whether that be picking up a personal project, adopting a kitten, practicing the stories you'll one day tell your grandkids about how you survived the end of the world, learning how to cook, any way to kill time, this too shall pass.

 So if you're a little behind on schoolwork, if your mood is a little off, if you're feeling a little down, if you slip up and forget a mask, don't beat yourself up. Keep an eye on each other, don't be afraid to reach out and get the help you need, give encouragement to fellow students and your professors (they need it too!), and do your best. We're all part of the Bulldog family, and there's no place I'd rather be than during a literal global pandemic. Hail damn State.

     As always if something is incorrect please let me know.

hxxdn1,Social Campus kicking renewal tenants out,"Hello everyone, I don‚Äôt know how active this subreddit it is, or even how helpful it will be to post this here. I‚Äôm posting this to serve as a warning and to see if there is anyone else in my situation. 

I have lived at the social campus for two years now, and back in about March I completed my renewal lease, so I could live there for another year. Well, 4 months later, who I thought would be my roommate gets an email with the tenants names on it and I‚Äôm not on it. Long story short, I renewed my lease, but when it came time, the office said I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt complete my renewal.‚Äù Which doesn‚Äôt make sense, because the process was short and all I had to do was write my name a couple of times and press submit. This also happened to a friend of mine, he had to drive from Memphis to Starkville all in a day to move all of his belongings out, otherwise ‚Äúit would all be thrown away.‚Äù

So I am just wondering if this has happened to anyone else? If there are more people that this happened to, this could be a very big issue for social campus that I intend on pursuing. It is ridiculous for this to happen to tenants who have completed their renewals. The office told him that they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have his file,‚Äù but told me ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt finish the process.‚Äù And if he also did ‚Äúnot finish the process,‚Äù then they would have his file. So something is fishy, and I hate the idea of a big company getting away with whatever they want simply because it is their word against yours.

If you know anyone that this has happened to, please comment or send me a PM.

i83xec,Rybolt Just Murdered My Schedule Up for This Semester,"I made a C in Managerial Acc this past semester.  Under normal circumstances this C would not meet the prerequisite rules needed to move along in the Accounting curriculum.  However, a C this past semester could have been changed to a P/F and it would have been accepted and allowed me to move along with my accounting classes.  But I received an email saying that my schedule had been altered and now the school is sending me a refund for $1,700.  I have already contacted my academic advisor and she told me everything would be alright but I am still shaken up. It's 5 days until school starts, I'm missing two core Accounting classes.  My schedule has been murdered.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are has this happened to any other accounting majors or maybe any other major that has special rules regarding their grade who chose to P/F a class?  What are the chances I get the same schedule I picked before my schedule was wrecked?  If I don't get the same schedule back after all this has been resolved, what are my options?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/i83xec/rybolt_just_murdered_my_schedule_up_for_this/,Academic_Corner_3905,1,2020-08-11 20:45:50,1,/r/Msstate/comments/i83xec/rybolt_just_murdered_my_schedule_up_for_this/

ic2wy0,E-Mail message from the Provost,"I'm providing this here for everyone who may not see this email from the Provost David Shaw due to not being on the mailing list or your email eating the message. It was sent through the Office of Public Affairs, opa@opa.msstate.edu. Think of it what you will.

&gt;This week‚Äôs message will be brief and focused on concerns that have been expressed as we enter the semester.  To those of you who disagree with any of the decisions we‚Äôve made about the fall, please don‚Äôt think we haven‚Äôt listened and considered the input. I‚Äôve read every comment you‚Äôve logged on the feedback website, the petitions, and the posts on the MSU Faculty/Staff Facebook page. Your feedback is invaluable to me and all of us on the task force.  Even when we disagree, I respect your opinion and carefully consider your perspective.
 
&gt;I can assure you that President Keenum and I, along with the entire COVID-19 Task Force, have taken all the varying viewpoints into consideration.  We have spent countless hours reading all of the science as it has emerged, and talked at great lengths with advisors, peers, and medical professionals. We‚Äôve pondered long about every decision we‚Äôve made and have readily admitted that the decision-making process is nearly impossible given the problems with every alternative evaluated. Things may go wrong during the semester, and right now we don‚Äôt know what will go well and what won‚Äôt.  But we are focused on trying to do what we believe is best given the myriad parameters and constraints that must be considered. I believe we have made plans that can adapt based on the situations that occur, and I would put our team of faculty and staff up against any other in the country in terms of professionalism and commitment.
 
&gt;I truly believe in our people, and all of us, regardless of our opinions on how the semester should be handled, know the impact MSU has on the lives of our students and the future of the most impoverished state in the nation. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here. Thus, as we move into the semester, I‚Äôd encourage us to approach it as one family; unified and respectful even as we sometimes disagree. We are all in this together.

&gt;Stay Healthy, and Hail State!

As a computer scientist concerned with privacy and security, I‚Äôm seeing plenty of sketchy things with Honorlock. I have no idea what level of pull SA has on this (likely not much), but I feel obligated to try to find a better way to maintain ethical testing. 

If you all wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing some experiences or opinions (both good and bad) on Honorlock, that would help. Also talk about your experiences *without* Honorlock. Was it a free for all? Did people cheat? Did the professors make the test more difficult or thorough to where it was less about memorization and more about understanding? ITS, do you think it‚Äôs a useful software? Are there better alternatives? 

I can‚Äôt promise anything (obviously) nor even really take a stance for or against it. But having a portfolio of anecdotals and other concerns is a start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/igof7p/honorlock_legislation/,Fireblade09,1,2020-08-25 20:15:47,46,/r/Msstate/comments/igof7p/honorlock_legislation/

ih5erf,"Dispelling common myths about Honorlock, and highlighting potential privacy issues.","In this post I will explain what Honorlock does not do, what it does do, and what there is to be concerned about. I am making this post after seeing some misinformation going around about what Honorlock is capable of doing. There are some privacy issues with the extension, I am just seeking to make sure that our claims against Honorlock are valid. Who am I to write this type of post? No one special really. I just did some research after I became curious. 

# What Honorlock Does not Do:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Collect your browser history. This does not appear anywhere in any of their terms of service. All they say related to this issue is "" Honorlock can log the websites you go to (or attempt to go to) from Chrome (which processes the request) and only when you are actively in an exam"" ([https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/](https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/))

2. Store processes that are running on your computer. Again, this does not appear anywhere in their terms. All they say on this matter is ""Since the extension is contained within the Chrome browser itself, it only has access to the limited operations that are provided by the browser ‚Äì nothing else"" ([https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/](https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/)). Honorlock is an extension, not a stand alone application or program. It runs through Chrome, and Honorlock goes onto say ""Google takes serious steps to ensure user privacy and will not allow unchecked access. They will in fact reject an extension submission if it‚Äôs an invasion of privacy or if the request for certain information isn‚Äôt warranted"" ([https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/](https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/))

3. Continually track you while you are not using the extension. ""The extension is only active while you are within the learning management system, and never accesses any personal or private data."" ([https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/](https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/)). Whether you believe that is up to you, but they repeat this sort of statement in their Honorlock Privacy Statement as well. They actually recommend that, if you want to feel extra safe, you ""Remove the Honorlock extension when the exam is over. Simply navigate to the extension in the toolbar of Chrome, right click, and remove. You can reinstall the extension for your next exam. It takes less than 30 seconds to install the Honorlock extension."" and ""You can create a new Chrome person to complete your testing with Honorlock. Open Chrome, navigate to the people tab across the top of your screen, then click create a new user. This means any bookmarks, passwords, etc., that you have saved will not show up in the Chrome window when you are testing."" ([https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/](https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/))

4. Sell Data. There are multiple sources for this. From MSU ""FERPA binds Honorlock to only collect, process, and store student data for contracted services and this information cannot be sold or transferred for any other purpose; Restricting access to our student data to only those within Honorlock with an authorized reason to process or view this data"" ([https://online.msstate.edu/honorlock/](https://online.msstate.edu/honorlock/)). MSU has a separate contract with Honorlock that supersedes any other agreement. Even if Honorlock could contractually sell our data, they cannot do to MSU's own policy.  Honorlock themselves also say they will not sell data 

5. Track your other devices on your network. This idea comes from a false understanding of how Honorlock's secondary device detection works. The only thing Honorlock can do is detect if you access their websites. They have websites that host fake questions and answers for tests. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/g1ziyd/honorlock_can_detect_use_of_multiple_devices_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

# What Can Honorlock Do

1. Store our video and audio recordings. This is done so that instructors can look back at flagged points in the video. 
2. Store your government ID. They store this, along with everything that your ID has on it. That includes your address and date of birth. I would recommend simply using your MSU ID for Honorlock, that way your address and what not will not be stored. What Honorlock says on this ""We also store your Photo and ID for a limited period of time after the exam, in case your school requires those for authentication."" ([https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/](https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/))
3. Track which tabs you open or attempt to open while taking the test
4. See anything that is immediately visible on your screen
5. Use cookie technology. ""We also collect information using ‚Äúcookie‚Äù technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a server stores on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device to ‚Äúremember‚Äù information about your visit. We may use session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer/device until you delete them). If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or mobile device.""  Almost all websites use cookies. This is not really an issue. 
6. Transfer your information over to another company if Honorlock gets sold to another company. "" As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the Information may be part of the transferred assets"". What is ""Information"" you may ask? Pretty much anything they have on you. Details from your government ID, video recordings, audio recordings, what type of device you use, etc. I listed pretty much all of the problematic data pieces here. So, if you use your MSU ID there is no issue with a lot of that. What type of device you use and a variety of other device data is mundane and not really a privacy issue. For example, what time you accessed the test and what URL you accessed the test from are things they also store and can transfer, but those things really are not a privacy violation. So, the biggest issue here is that, contractually speaking, they can give your video recordings to another company if Honorlock gets bought by said company. 

# How Long can Honorlock Store your Information?

Up to 6 months, then it will be destroyed. ([https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/](https://honorlock.com/student-privacy-statement/))

# Here are a variety of other things Honorlock does to protect safety. 

I bolded really important things. 

 

* Honorlock is hosted in the cloud through Amazon Web Services
* **Honorlock stores information for six months and then purges that data.** Honorlock, as an AWS partner, follows federal NIST 800-88 guidelines for proof of data/drive destruction. AWS procedures include a decommissioning process that is designed to prevent customer data from being exposed to unauthorized individuals. AWS uses the techniques detailed in DoD 5220.22-M (‚ÄúNational Industrial Security Program Operating Manual ‚Äú) or NIST 800-88 (‚ÄúGuidelines for Media Sanitization‚Äù) to destroy data as part of the decommissioning process.
* **Data transmission is secure to industry standards. Data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2, with SHA-256 and RSA 2048-bit public key for ALL data transfers in and out of our system. All transmission of data to and from our network is handled using SSL. All data transmitted into our platform is received over SSL to our web servers and our APIs. Data is transmitted back to our customers through our web servers using SSL. Data in transmission is encrypted following up-to-date SSL protocols, as certified by our latest vulnerability scan.**
* **Data being store**d is encrypted. All data is secure using industry standards with AES-256 block encryption.
* **Honorlock is not the owner of the data, but holds the data for the university.** Honorlock employees do not have access to the data unless their job requires it (ie support or proctors). If they do have authorized access, it‚Äôs behind VPN and their access is tracked, logged, and audited.
* Honorlock requires no account or password. We collect as little as possible because we are integrated with the LMS. We use your access to the LMS to give you access to your exam when proctoring is enabled.
* **Honorlock employees are trained and certified, which includes FERPA Training**. All Honorlock employees receive training on how to use our product, FERPA, Incident 4 Response, and Data Protection. All support and proctoring employees also conduct jobspecific training and certifications for supporting the product, supporting students, and how to proctor effectively.
* **Honorlock has SOCII Certification which means its data, security, and business practices are audited annually by an outside independent third party.**
* Honorlock has an information security policy and logical security policies which are related strictly to protecting data and student privacy.
* Honorlock conducts routine vulnerability assessments, scans, and penetration testing to ensure we continue to protect all data at all costs. These tests are performed by independent third parties.
* Honorlock is GDPR and CCPA compliant. These policies are publicly available on our website. Honorlock is GDPR compliant. Read our GDPR &amp; Privacy Shield Notice [here](https://honorlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Honorlock_Website_Privacy_Policy.pdf). ¬†If a student requests to have their information removed they will be provided a Right to Erasure Request Form. After receiving that request, Honorlock will contact the institution to ensure they are aware of the request, they have adequate time to download (or with our assistance provide them) the media prior to deletion for perseverance of the student academic records. The student will be provided the confirmation of the deletion once its been completed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/ih5erf/dispelling_common_myths_about_honorlock_and/,jonahn2000,1,2020-08-26 15:19:52,2,/r/Msstate/comments/ih5erf/dispelling_common_myths_about_honorlock_and/

ihriyq,Chess Club Creation,"Hello all! I was browsing the clubs present here and found that the old chess club has practically been abandoned. I am interested in reorganizing and creating another chess club, but I need at least 6 people to sign up before I can officially create the club. I also need an advisor for the club.

The chess club that I want to create will eventually lean more towards competitiveness, but casual players would still be welcomed! In fact, the club may start off more casual for the first year since I don‚Äôt know how many people on the campus are familiar with the competitive aspect of chess. I am hoping to maybe hold small cash prize tournaments every week or two, puzzle solving days, and potentially chess opening lectures. I could also hold events where someone from our chess club plays multiple people at once (a simul) or could play a fun team based version of chess called Bughouse. I want to eventually reach the goal of traveling across the country to compete against other universities or just experience the thrill of individual tournaments. I also want to incorporate MSU with some awesome chess designed T-Shirts. I was thinking of something in relation to a maroon checkered shirt with a black knight in the front. 

For a short summary of my chess career, I have about 8 years of experience with chess. I hail from New Orleans, Louisiana and have peaked at a USCF Chess rating of 1729 if anyone is familiar with the rating system. My rating roughly translates more towards above average in terms of competitive chess players. Anyways, I have won over $6,000 in chess prizes and have won several first and runner up places in many tournaments around New Orleans, Louisiana. What I love most about chess is the community that is built within it. When you attend tournaments or even just play casually, you make new friends and even can meet people from all over the world! Money is also a nice side treat. 

I haven‚Äôt played chess in a year due to the fact that there wasn‚Äôt an active chess club last year. However, I hope that this will change this year! Chess is truly an amazing game! Many people associate chess with something like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what nerds play‚Äù when that isn‚Äôt the case most of the time. Chess involves people of all walks of life. Some people from my chess club in New Orleans were also apart off many different other types of hobbies such as football, basketball, and whatever. Also, intelligence is another misconception perceived about chess. Just because you aren‚Äôt an absolute genius doesn‚Äôt mean that you won‚Äôt be great at chess. Take me for example. I beat someone who made a perfect score on the ACT and now attends Yale multiple times although I made a much lower score than him on the ACT. It‚Äôs not a flex but just an example that just because someone is ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù than you doesn‚Äôt automatically mean that they are better than you at something involving intelligence.

Hopefully, some of you enjoyed my read and are interested in creating a chess club. If you are interested, then please shoot me an email at bra107@msstate.edu. For everyone else, I hope you too enjoyed my read, and if you aren‚Äôt interested, then please relay this information to anyone who may be interested in this.

iiduyl,"An open letter to the Administration and SA of MS State University, by a concerned student.","To the Admin of MSU: 

I am a transfer student. I have enjoyed my first two weeks here at MSU, and look forward to continuing my higher education. However, I have to address the the elephant in the room. Or rather, the virus in the room. 

The school has pushed the message that it is student responsibility that will determine if we go online or stay in person this semester. This is especially relevant now, at the time of writing as we have currently reached 500+ students in quarantine/isolation. 100+ of those students are being quarantined in the hotel room MSU rented for this semester. And if my numbers are correct, that means we have 50-ish units left to give to on campus students. 

 And in some ways, I do not disagree with the fact the members of the student community have some blame. Public health is both a individual and community effort. Those who go out to bars, party and participate in at-risk behaviors are willingly putting themselves in the way of the virus.  But I can no longer sit and pretend that this lies completely with the students. Let me state some things I have observed on campus: 

1. MSU tells students not to gather, but allows students to do so in the Union while they eat, without their masks on. I have high doubts that these students having lunch together all happen to live together. 
2. Several of the dorms have communal bathrooms, where all the students on the same floor use the same showers and toilets. Also, dorms are highly communal living situations, where isolating yourself form others is extremely difficult.  How is this not a petri dish?
3. Greek Life Houses have been allowed to accept new residents. Greek Life living is highly communal, like dorms, and has a culture of gathering and partying.. along with a culture of not following the rules (I am highlighting a national trend in Greek Life culture, not any specific chapter/organization).
4. And finally, their is the fact that due to the nearly universal party culture of universities in this country, many of said parties are already underground due to underage drinking/drugs,  and the nation-wide phenomenon of people not taking the virus seriously and refusing to follow proper guidelines: MSU chose to reopen in-person anyways. 

The basic question that I keep having is.. What did MSU expect to happen? This is was a powder keg waiting to explode. Even institutions like Harvard admitted that going online was the best option for this semester. 

Let us not forget the fact that MSU, despite knowing that we have a high chance of having to return to online instruction, still required freshman students to get a dorm. Still required people to get parking decals and dinning plans. With no sight of even the possibility of a refund. And this is not to mention the numerous students who are 100% online this semester, not by their own choosing, and still had to pay a full in-person tuition! 

I understand that their is a lot of local economy, politics, and business involved in the decision to re-open in person, I understand that Starkville  and the people who work for MSU rely on in-person classes to bring bread on the table. But it honestly doesn't feel like MSU is truly prepared for an in-person semester that keeps the students and community safe. 

And I don't expect them to be. I don't think any institution could reopen safely this semester. Going online feels more inevitable each day, and I only wish MSU was more honest about that. I wish the Admin could simply admit to their limitations instead of  painting a fantasy and then blaming the students when it inevitably crashes and burns. 

And this is especially frustrating for people like me, who follows all the guidelines, stays in their apartment instead of partying, and have to deal with the fear of still getting the virus (despite doing all those things) becasue we are forced to go to in-person classes.

And to SA... the role of a student government is to hold the institution Admin accountable to the student body. Decisions by the admin should be analyzed and questioned by student government, to ensure that they are truly in the student body's best interest. And it should do so publicly, so that all students can informed about the decisions that are impacting their education.  It appears that the MSU SA has refused to fulfill this basic purpose, and due to that... I am heavily disappointed. 

And I think that sums up my feelings on the matter. Disappointed.

iowy79,OPA Letter From the Provost - Important Spring Semester information,"This is the letter from the Office of Public Affairs, Letter from the Provost David Shaw. Of note, there is some particularly important information for the spring semester in this, so please read up and plan accordingly. I've added emphasis to the section students will find most pressing.

&gt;This week, again, I want to start with another huge thank you.  Three weeks into the semester, we are holding our own!  We had a solid plan in place, and to this point the plan has worked well.  It is great to have students back, even under such abnormal circumstances. Our faculty and staff have done a magnificent job in making this first three weeks of the semester successful. So at a deeply personal level, I want to express my appreciation to each and everyone one of you.
 
&gt;Recently a memo went out to all employees, informing you of mental health resources available to all employees and your families. The pandemic, coupled with attempting to do our jobs in such a difficult environment, has created a great deal of stress, and we are working to further enhance our support system for emotional needs.  Please see https://www.hrm.msstate.edu/benefits/eap/. I‚Äôd encourage everyone to give a special measure of grace to those you work with or supervise, and to focus on what is mission-critical for the university this fall rather than expecting the same as in BC (before COVID) times.
 
&gt;We are continually updating the COVID-19 website, and recently added new FAQs, and also an explanation of the decision-making process for any actions to suspend classes or quarantine groups of students in residence halls or Greek houses.  Check out the latest information at https://www.msstate.edu/covid19.
 
&gt;It was wonderful to see the announcement in the news over the weekend that OCH Medical Center (on that date) had zero COVID-19 patients!  Given the increase in our population with the students back on campus, that is a strong statement of how well we are all following guidance on precautionary measures for health safety. We can‚Äôt let our guard down, but I wanted to thank everyone for making health safety your priority.
 
&gt;This past week we began using an additional hotel property for isolation and quarantine purposes, the Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites in Columbus. Having this property allows for ample time for the cleaning &amp; sanitization and turnover of rooms as students leave these facilities. We have heard some reports of slow internet connectivity in the Comfort Suites property. These issues are intermittent, and we are working with the property owners to address this concern. Should you hear of an issue, please encourage the student to call the 24/7 staffed phone line at 662-325-4140. We have internet hotspots available to assist in these instances. 
 
&gt;Believe it or not, we are already beginning to plan for a winter intersession and the spring semester.  The winter intersession will be a full five-week term, similar to a summer session.  Reception to this idea has been strongly positive, and will give our students whose lives have been disrupted the opportunity to take a course or two to help them stay on track for graduation. **For the spring semester, our fundamental assumption is that it will need to be similar to the fall, with a mix of face-to-face, hybrid, and online courses. We are planning to eliminate spring break, thus shortening the semester by a week.** Much more information has been and will be provided to your deans and department heads in the next couple of weeks.
 
&gt;In closing, I appreciate the words of encouragement that many have sent.  I also appreciate the feedback and concerns that others have expressed, and ask that all of you continue to feel free to share your thoughts, concerns and ideas in whatever mechanism that works best for you.

&gt;Stay Healthy and Hail State!
David Shaw

j24u4l,[Academic] Survey on College Students Perceptions of Individual Privacy and Trust in Digitized Contact Tracing (Undergraduate College Students Only),"This is IRB approved research.

Approved by Moderators.

Dear prospective participant,

We would like you to participate in a research survey that is being led by Clemson University‚Äôs Analytics and Data Lab. Our survey gauges college students on their perceptions of individual privacy and privacy of location and space and how it relates to trust when adopting an institution led digitized contact tracing application.

* You need to be an undergraduate college student at a two-year or four-year college in the United States.
* This survey will take 10 to 15 minutes to take.
* At the end of the survey is a sign up for optional follow-up interviews that will be led by students of our Analytics and Data Lab.
* Your survey answers remain anonymous outside of the Analytics and Data Lab and will be used internally by us to create a big picture of college students‚Äô point of view on individual location privacy when it comes to a digitized contact tracing application, something that is extremely important in today‚Äôs day and age considering the on-going COVID-19 epidemic.  

   * The only personal identifiable information being collected will be your gender, ethnicity, the college you are currently attending, current class standing, and major.

The survey will open September 1st, 2020, and close October 1st, 2020, or when we reach 200 participants.

Please let us know if you have any questions and again thank you so much.

jbebf0,MSU releases Spring Semester 2021 academic guidelines,"STARKVILLE ‚Äì STARKVILLE, Miss.‚Äî In response to students and their families seeking specific additional information and guidance regarding the Spring Semester 2021, Mississippi State University is aware that the Fall Semester 2020 has been a unique learning experience of delivering courses safely and effectively to MSU students.

As we prepare for the Spring Semester 2021, we consider the situation we may expect from a pandemic standpoint, coupled with what we have learned from the fall semester.

The Spring Semester 2021 will include an increased number of courses that are offered face-to-face (F2F) but still maintaining social distancing and face mask requirements.

When a course is offered F2F, faculty are to revert to the accommodations provided by our academic operating policies (AOPs).

Livestreaming or video capture will not be required of every course if the instructor has other effective means of delivering accommodations for those students with excused absences. Audio/video capture will still be available as an option for those faculty who choose that as a means of academic accommodation. The university certainly encourages the use of this technology. Additional strategies utilizing best practices to accommodate students may include providing slides and handouts, online office hours and chat rooms, etc.

Students who miss class must obtain documentation for an excused absence in keeping with our AOPs and requirements outlined in the course syllabus. Students with absences due to COVID-19 precautions/quarantining may be required to obtain an excused absence from the Longest Student Health Center. Other non-COVID-19 absences will require an excuse. Instructors should still be compassionate as the university continues to try to maintain best practices during this pandemic.

Faculty must state the course delivery method prior to enrollment, allowing students to know what to expect when they enroll, and hold to that delivery method for the semester except in exceptional circumstances, and only as approved by the dean and provost.

Faculty teaching F2F classes are encouraged to consider lessons learned from the fall semester and incorporate effective synchronous and asynchronous learning tools to enhance the educational outcomes for students. While recording class attendance is challenging with the various modes of instruction employed, it is highly encouraged to take attendance to help with student engagement and accountability.

Faculty teaching hybrid courses that are choosing to have F2F components must clearly define the days and weeks in which classroom attendance will be required. That allows the students to plan their schedule more effectively and will aid in more effective classroom utilization, given the high demand for classroom space under physical distancing requirements. This information must be communicated to the students prior to the first day of classes.

Faculty should post the course syllabi on the web (in Banner) prior to registration advising. Hence, students understand the instructional mode and level of effort required to complete the course (e.g., assignments, assessments, etc.).

Departments and faculty are encouraged to work with students to avoid issues and conflicts regarding exams and other major assessments. Online students can only be administered online assessments; that is, they cannot be required to come to campus to take an exam. Common exams resulting in conflicts with other scheduled classes will result in an accommodation for the course that caused the conflict. Final exams will follow the AOPs in terms of timing and delivery method.

MSU believes that transparency regarding these issues with students, their families, and our dedicated faculty and staff is the key to eliminating confusion and inconsistency in the application of these academic guidelines and requirements.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/jbebf0/msu_releases_spring_semester_2021_academic/,Change-Dazzling,1,2020-10-14 21:39:26,15,/r/Msstate/comments/jbebf0/msu_releases_spring_semester_2021_academic/

jesht8,Graduation Gift Etiquette?,"Hello, 

My husband finally graduated from MSU this Summer after having to return to school 2 times due to job problems, but he finally graduated!  He is in his mid-30s and we live out of state but still plan to walk in the ceremony in November and we have been trying to figure out gift etiquette. My father helped tutor him in numerous classes over the past few years, and has been invited to the ceremony. His parents helped pay for the degree. Is it good etiquette to get them a gift? If so, what kind of gift would you get them? 

Also, as a wife, ideas for what to get my husband? I surprised him with a week long vacation in August when he passed his last final, but I want to to surprise him with something at the actual graduation. He is not super into ""school branding"" or anything, so he is not really wanting tons of expensive ""MSU"" things, but I want to get him something nice. Thoughts?

jfhbqs,Accepted to MSU should I go?," 

I know this has been asked, and I've read through them. Unlike most of the time it is asked, I am a MUCH OLDER, NON-TRADITIONAL STUDENT. I have been accepted to MSU, Finance. I am going back to college, 40+ using my veteran's benefits.

I'm not 100% sure I'm choosing MSU. Also accepted and considering LSU, Alabama, Miss State, Ole Miss, U of Houston, and Auburn. I posted something similar on the other school sites.

I've lived in the south most of my life, 1/2 time big city, 1/2 time Deliverance country. I do have a strong dislike for the Trumpsters, I'm not a liberal either, just cannot stomach the Trumpster crowd. But I am able to get along with them. I try to just stay apolitical. Is MSU better for a 'non-traditional' student, someone not in a frat or a 'bro'? Are the school and area better for older, lower socio-economic, more 'blue-collar' type than a trump flag waiving psycho or rich-kid frat brat?

What is the area like? The people? Although, I'm older and not going to be necessarily living the 'college experience', I love sports and would love to be in a walkable area, so I like the idea of living close to campus. I know nothing at all about MS or the Starkville area. Outside of school, my life will pretty much be the gym, mma, any theatre &amp; arts type stuff, maybe meeting a future wifey, nothing major. What are some areas living further out?

kfb7ew,Desperate Plea for MSU chocolate milk (seriously!!),"Hi! I know this might sound weird, but I've spent the last 4+ years of my life dedicated to reviewing chocolate milk around the world. All the reviews and videos are on [afoolzerrand.com](https://afoolzerrand.com/) \-- and I'm planning a big road trip through Mississippi just after Christmas to visit some of the chocolate milk producing farms-- a step toward trying every chocolate milk available in the US. üòÖI'm currently the admin of the [r/chocolatemilk](https://www.reddit.com/r/chocolatemilk/) so if you're a choc milk fan-- please check out the sub!

MSU closes on 12/22, and doesn't re-open until early January. I believe the MSU chocolate milk ([https://www.msucheese.com/milk/](https://www.msucheese.com/milk/)) is only sold at the MAFES Sales store on campus, which will also be closed. I plan on coming through Starkville area on Monday 12/28, and would be ETERNALLY INDEBTED to anyone who would be able to buy a few units (doesn't matter what size) of the chocolate milk, keep it in the fridge, and meet me somewhere in Starkville or on campus on 12/28! I'm happy to pay for your troubles (and the milk of course!).

Again, I know this sounds strange, but I'd love to review every chocolate milk from Mississippi, and I'm not sure when I'll get to return to MS (I live in NC). I've reviewed many other university chocolate milks (NC St., Cornell, Middle Tennessee St., Penn St., Kansas St., BYU, Wisconsin..) as it's a pretty rare thing for a university to have its own brand.

I know it's a long-shot, but I'd be super appreciative if someone was able to buy some MSU choc milk (before 12/22) and meet up with me on 12/28. Totally understand if it's too weird of a request or if everyone is busy with (much more important) family stuff. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/kfb7ew/desperate_plea_for_msu_chocolate_milk_seriously/,afoolzerrand,5,2020-12-17 20:33:21,37,/r/Msstate/comments/kfb7ew/desperate_plea_for_msu_chocolate_milk_seriously/

ku03u2,Volunteers to lead English as a Second Language Virtual Groups,"Hey everyone, we're trying to bring the English Cluster Program, a student-led organization that started at Ole Miss and is now at multiple universities across the country, to MSU. This program provides free, non-credit English as a Second Language (ESL) workshops &amp; conversation hours to international students. who want to practice/improve their English skills in a casual environment. These are typically led by students who are native (or at least near-fluent) English speakers and interested in volunteering to assist international students and/or gaining teaching experience.

Cluster topics can range anywhere from skill-based (i.e. pronunciation) to topic-based (i.e. American movies) to casual conversation-based (i.e. discussion of current events, practicing English by playing games). While the volunteer opportunities in this program are great for those studying to become English/ESL teachers or wanting to teach abroad, we still welcome those who are not. The type of Cluster that you would be able to lead (a more casual conversation hour format vs. one on pronunciation) will depend on your background, knowledge, and experience, but anyone from freshmen to graduate students can participate.

For the Spring, all of these Clusters will be virtual and will go from February through April. Clusters meet once a week for around an hour and there's a lot of flexibility for the day/time that they can be led. In addition to these Clusters being open to all international students at MSU, we're combining the English Clusters across all of the universities that our organization is at (i.e. Ole Miss, LSU, UGA, etc.) this Spring since most things are virtual anyway. This means that an international student here can participate in a Cluster led by someone at a different university, and vice-versa.

If leading one of the Clusters for this program sounds like something you might be interested in, visit uiasaa.com or dm me for more information!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/ku03u2/volunteers_to_lead_english_as_a_second_language/,at11b5,1,2021-01-09 16:41:39,2,/r/Msstate/comments/ku03u2/volunteers_to_lead_english_as_a_second_language/

l2rzm8,Ticket Appeal Chance of Success,"TL;DR:  For 10 minutes, I parked out of zone at Garner Hall because two cars, who eventually got tickets themselves for going over their parking time, hogged up the only two visitor spaces during rain.  

&amp;#x200B;

I drove to Garner Hall this morning to talk to account services.  There are only two visitor parking spaces and when I got there, they were both taken.  One car in these two spots even had a ticket given to them while they were in the spot.  So, I waited for  a good 5 or 6 minutes for one of the spaces to become available.  None did. (As I am writing this, I am remembering that I have a dash cam that can back all of this up, if it even matters if I go to appeal it.)

&amp;#x200B;

So, anyway, I chose to take the risk and park way out in the parking lot in staff parking and figured I will take the risk of getting a ticket.  The problem is that I didn't think I would actually get one.  When I came back out to my car after about 10 minutes in Garner, I actually saw the guy writing me the ticket.  He asked me if this was my car, I told him it was.  I told him I was in there on business, I told him that the two cars in the visitor parking spots were in the spots in excess of the time allowed (btw the other car in the spots ended up getting a ticket as well), and I even showed him the papers and business cards in my hand to prove I had business in Garner.  But he basically said, ""Sorry, I can't take it back.""  He was nice about it, I was nice about it.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is that if I appeal this ticket (which costs another $5 if I lose), does anyone have any idea of what my chances are at successfully appealing it if I argue my case?  Or is this a case of ""Thanks for admitting your parking violation in writing/person, now pay us.""  But I would really like to win this.  $30 ticket?  That's my pizza money right there.

&amp;#x200B;

\-  As a second semester Junior, I have never had a MSU speeding/parking ticket before

\-  Occupants of the only two visiting spots both received tickets for time violation

\-  I parked way out away from the buildings

\-  There were plenty of open spaces and did not deprive anyone of a parking space

\-  I was in Garner on business and was parked for no more than 10 minutes

\-  Drove because of rain",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/l2rzm8/ticket_appeal_chance_of_success/,GiveLeachMoreTime,1,2021-01-22 12:05:46,14,/r/Msstate/comments/l2rzm8/ticket_appeal_chance_of_success/

And dont get me started on the lady with the white hair who works at the cashier at fresh food because she gets so mad  when I get something other than traditional for take out like she needs to mind her business and let me get what I paid for. Its gotten to the point where I have to try and sneak to get something for my takeout. It shoudnt have to be that way especially with us students having to pay thousands for our education... So who can I talk to so we can have more options for takeout because this is ridiculous!!  I miss when we could get anything we wanted for takeout and not just the traditional food.

mm2hh6,Study Opportunity,"Hi! I‚Äôm a graduate student working on my Master‚Äôs project. My teammates and I have designed a sound-based virtual coworking platform and we're looking to evaluate it with undergrads and graduate students who have experience visiting public spaces with others around (libraries, coffee shops, etc.) to study or do their work.

If you're interested in volunteering, you will participate in a two-part research study. The two sessions will take place on separate days, and each session will last up to 1.5 hours max. You will be asked to complete three different tasks while using the virtual coworking space and a comparable system. With your permission, we will also ask you to take a screen recording and screenshots while using our system for a small portion of the session. At the end, you will answer questions about your experience with using our system.

We expect to enroll up to 20 participants for this study. Participants will be compensated $15 for the first session and $20 for the second session, totaling $35 for the entire study. Compensation will be provided in the form of an Amazon gift card. If you or someone you know is interested in participating in this research project, please complete this 3-minute eligibility survey: [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_5yCsTWmulgjXkWi](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5yCsTWmulgjXkWi)

n1bklp,I created a large student survey last summer (450 redditors participated) and am back with survey #2,"If you check my post history you'll see that I circulated a student survey last summer across various college subreddits. About 450 students participated, and the survey data was written up in a [Medium Piece](https://medium.com/@liviamorris/i-feel-that-the-future-ive-been-working-towards-my-whole-life-is-gone-now-what-students-have-b33e5d09456b?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ef9ef45585d8c9c8aff6eaa007cd09d3).

Now that we've been in the pandemic for over a year, I'd love to get your guys' feedback once again. The first survey was largely about the difficulties of adjusting to the pandemic, while this one is focused more on how the pandemic has impacted mental health and mentorship, as well as whether you feel that your campus is supportive of students who want to pursue independent projects (e.g. startups, creative endeavors, on-campus initiatives, etc.). All responses are anonymous (no personal info is collected) and you can opt whether to have your responses included in the write-up. 

If anyone has questions, please feel free to ask. And if anyone wants a copy of the raw data when it's ready, PM me and I'll add your name to the list. 

Thanks so much - and good luck with midterms/finals!

Job Details: 

Common activities include: 

- Being his ‚Äúwriter‚Äù in class and on tests
- Helping him understand his homework 
- Aiding in the studying process for his tests 

He is a business - management major, so it would be preferred if the tutor was also a business major. However, that is not required. 

You are officially on MSU payroll. Because it is a student position, it obviously isn‚Äôt paid that well. However, the flexibility made it a perfect job for me during the school year. He is great about working with your schedule, and has regularly given a Christmas bonus.

To participate in this survey you must be one of the following:

* 18+ undergraduate student who was enrolled or currently enrolled in an a class offered via Zoom, Teams, or other video conferencing software
* 18+ professor
* 18+ graduate student teaching assistant or teacher of record

**************************

**eduroam**

eduroam is the primary wireless network on the MSU campus. Instructions for connecting may be found here: https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/45/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=16

Additionally, eduroam is a federated service that allows all students and employees that visit another participating institution the ability to connect to their wireless infrastructure. There are locations across the US and the world that are part of the eduroam alliance: https://eduroam.org

**msu3**

msu3 is a hidden SSID that may be used to connect devices to the wireless network if they do not support 802.1x standards. (Game consoles, streaming media devices, smartwatches, etc) You must register the MAC address of the device to use this network. Instructions may be found here: https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/45/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=1115

**msuguest**

If you have guests such as your parents on campus that need to get online, you can get the daily password our guest wireless network at https://its.msstate.edu/msuguest. It's also written and presented in a few public spots, primarily Barnes and Noble Cafe.

**VPN**

MSU offers VPN connectivity to the campus network via Cisco AnyConnect. You may use this service to connect to the MSU network and secure your connection from prying eyes when off-campus and on public networks, no matter where in the world you are. Certain services such as admin Banner also require VPN connectivity when off-campus. Visit https://vpn.msstate.edu to get started, and instructions for all desktop/mobile devices may be found here: https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/45/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=80

**Microsoft 365**

MSU provides access to Microsoft 365 services for students and employees. These services include OneNote, OneDrive (5TB), Teams/SharePoint Online, Exchange Online (more on that below), Forms, Planner, Lists, Stream, To-Do, Sway, and Power Automate.

Visit https://office.com or https://m365.msstate.edu to reach your Microsoft 365 portal. Your portal also contains the download link for the suite of Office desktop apps -- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, Publisher, and Access ‚Äì AT NO COST! (Now named Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise) This is available for macOS/Windows and may be installed on your personal devices. Any available mobile versions of these various Microsoft applications may be found in the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

**Email**

Related to the above, student and employee email is hosted in Exchange Online as part of our Microsoft 365 services.  You may access your mail from the Outlook mobile/desktop clients, Outlook on the Web via a browser, or any 3rd party mail client that support OAuth 2.0 (Modern Authentication) such as iOS/macOS Mail, Thunderbird, and some built-in mobile email apps (Samsung Email, Gmail off the top of my head). Information on access email may be found here: https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/45/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=101

For the most reliable experience, my recommendation is to use the first-party Microsoft clients -- Outlook mobile/desktop/browser apps. If, for example, Apple or Samsung or some other 3rd party has a bug in their implementations of EAS/EWS + OAuth 2.0 (which has happened), we have no recourse for solutions beyond bug reports and waiting/hoping that they fix their problem.

**File Locker**

FileLocker is a temporary and secure storage system for sharing data (up to 4GB) with anyone. The service may be access at https://filelocker.msstate.edu and more instructions may be found here: https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/45/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=1033


**University-Provided Software**

The university provides several software suites at no cost to students and employees. You may find this list and instructions to obtain each piece of software here: https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/45/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=1210

**Duo**

Duo is the two-factor authentication (2FA) service required to access MSU‚Äôs online services. Duo 2FA provides an extra layer of security by requiring you to perform an additional authentication step that only you can complete.  This may be accepting a push approval to your phone, providing a code generated by an application, or inserting a supported hardware token into your device. This prevents hackers and other bad actors from accessing your accounts even if your password becomes compromised. More info may be found here: https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/45/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=34

If you ever forget or lose your device enrolled in Duo, you may always generate a one-time bypass code or enroll/unenroll devices using our self-service tools at https://2fa.msstate.edu.

**NetPasswords and Security**

Your NetPassword is the centralized password synced all MSU online services, including MyState, Canvas, email, and more. If you ever need to reset your netPassword, you may do so at http://netpassword.msstate.edu.

Also be aware of these security tips:

‚Ä¢	Never share your password with anyone
‚Ä¢	ITS will never ask for your password; Anyone claiming to be ‚ÄúIT‚Äù or ‚ÄúITS‚Äù requesting your password via email, phone, or in person will always be a scammer.
‚Ä¢	Avoid re-using the same password across multiple services. Password re-use helps hackers, as they only need to compromise credentials from a single service, and then try the same username/password combination in other places such as your social media or banking accounts.
‚Ä¢	Never approve Duo 2FA pushes that you did NOT initiate. If you receive a Duo push approval request on your phone that you did not initiate, Deny the request and immediately change your NetPassword. 
‚Ä¢	Be cautious of potential phishing and scam emails urging you to provide your password, enter sensitive information into websites, etc.
‚Ä¢	Double-check a sender‚Äôs email address when someone contacts you claiming they are a specific person, and then demands immediate action and creates a sense of urgency. This may possibly be the start of a gift card scam or a phishing attempt. If in doubt, reach out to the person by directly emailing a known email address (not replying to the message you received initially), or contacting them by other means such as phone or instant messaging to confirm you are not communicating with a scammer.
‚Ä¢	Remember, if an email looks suspicious, it probably is! If you are ever concerned about the legitimacy of an email, contact the ITS Service Desk at 662-325-0631 or servicedesk@msstate.edu.

plbaj6,"NC State fan in town for the game this weekend, coming in peace, looking for recommendations","Hi everybody,

I'm making a road trip to Starkville this weekend for the game and wanted to pick the brains of those who knew best. Any suggestions on places to eat/drink/hang out are welcome. I'll only be there for one night and I'm staying close to downtown. I can't decide if I want to park at my place of lodging and walk to the stadium while making bar stops along the way, or set up in a parking lot or something closer to the stadium and drink cans of domestic beer out of my tailgate. Seems like there may be a pay lot roughly to the north of the stadium on campus based on a parking map I found, dunno how feasible that strategy would be, however.

&amp;#x200B;

Other miscellaneous questions:

Are there places that away fans tend to gather where I might find some of my people?

Is it considered kosher for an opposing fan to watch the dawg walk?

Is it true that Mike Leach is going to address the fans before the game? (Couldn't tell you where I heard this, but I am under the impression that he is going to make a speech at the Junction for some reason)

And lastly, where is a good spot to hang out after the game and have a good time? Any spots favored by students you'd recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

Might not get a chance to check this until tomorrow, but any and all responses appreciated!

Firing a coach in any less than 3 years is dumb in most cases. Give coaches a chance to build a roster, to build their culture. Can‚Äôt rebuild a program if we fire coaches in the rebuilding phase. Moorhead after 2 years I understood. The team culture under him was bad and he had little authority over the team. Players wouldn‚Äôt listen to him, he was too nice. Leach is showing progress between seasons, we‚Äôre better now than we ever were last season. If we fire leach at this point we‚Äôre just gonna keep spiraling downwards

ptirsv,Here‚Äôs a run down on how artists selection happens for Bulldog Bash and Music Makers,"Okay so back when I was at State (within the last 5 years) I did an article for my news writing class on how Music Makers selects artists. Was told Bulldog Bash uses the same method. 

First they get an idea of what their budget is (remember this is a free show, so it‚Äôs not a lot). 

Second, they look at what genres they have done the last few years to make sure no genre is neglected. They try to select one that hasn‚Äôt had an artist in that genre a long time to make sure they hit across the genres over the course of a student‚Äôs four years. (This is the funny thing, people are complaint about Hardy saying ‚Äúour student body is too diverse for this‚Äù but they selected a country artist because there hasn‚Äôt been one in a while so they aimed for one this year. So catering to a part of the diverse body is why this happened)

Third, they talk to an agent with these two things in mind and ask for a list of who my be available. (A big part of this is who is touring nearby, and is traveling from Nashville/Atlanta/Memphis to New Orleans or something, they can get them to detour at an affordable price)

Fourth, agent gives them a list of people who could come for that price. They pick one and then try to negotiate a deal.

Naturally, this is a very simplified version, but I hope it explains why SA didn‚Äôt get exactly who you wanted this year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/ptirsv/heres_a_run_down_on_how_artists_selection_happens/,BehindEnemyLines8923,6,2021-09-22 19:41:25,23,/r/Msstate/comments/ptirsv/heres_a_run_down_on_how_artists_selection_happens/

qihk06,Strange Brew did something shitty (again),"So disappointing because their pastries (not so much coffee lol) are pretty good.
For those who don't know about OCD, there are a ton of misconceptions. It's seen nowadays as something quirky but I can tell you it is not. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists OCD in the top ten most debilitating disabilities. I pray that none of you have to experience it.
Then comes Strange Brew with their new mugs (photo in comments below) mocking OCD and making it out to be funny.
I commented and let them know that this mug is offensive and ableist, coming from someone who has OCD. They immediately blocked me and didn't respond to any Facebook messages.
I am absolutely disgusted to say the least. You wouldn't have a quirky mug about cancer, so why is it ok to have one about OCD?

1. I am a Environmental Science in Agricultural Systems Major, wondering what kind of jobs and where a lot of Ag kids work after college, is it only in Mississippi or are students competitive with large/ out of state companies? 

2. I am interested in joining a fraternity next year and got the impression that MS State has a more chillaxed Greek Life compared to other schools in the SEC. Am I wrong with this assumption or is there fraternities who are not insane with the partying (if you could give some names of some that would be awesome!). 

3. Coming from the Upper Midwest I have heard a lot from others that I will experience a major culture shock and will not fit in. I don‚Äôt believe this personally but wanted to get the Reddit‚Äôs opinion. 

4. I have heard somethings about campus and Starkville totally shutting down when it‚Äôs not a football weekend. Is it true that everybody goes home or is there enough going on with kids on campus to have some fun.

A large part of why I'd like this position is the 6 credit hours a semester that I could use to finish my degree. I had to drop out for financial reasons after 3 semesters back in 2014.

His outward appearance made him seem homeless but he wasnt. I took him home from main street many nights after play practice at the community theater. His apartment was neat as a pin. He sometimes seemed kind of gruff, but underneath that exterior was a kind gentleman who will be dearly missed. It's people like him that make my hometown of Starkville a great place.

te7y4h,PSA: Paid parking around Starkville starts tomorrow.,"Hi everyone, for anyone who hasn't heard, paid parking starts around Starkville tomorrow. Areas effected: Basically Pita Pit all the way to Campus. Includes the Cotton District. 

The only way to park is to use the Park Mobile app (used by campus). Enforcement is in effect from 8am-8pm and is active on weekdays. $1.10 per hour. 

Personal opinion time: very opposed to this move, mostly because of the extreme restrictions around paying. Its a bad move to limit this to only mobile payments. What about older folks who dont have a smart phone? Its not simple to tell this population: ""oh just download park mobile and add your credit card to it."" 

There should at least be some meters or an 'analog' way to pay. Im all for offering more options but this is too restrictive.

ttv82h,Why State?," So, I am leaving the army next June, am applying to schools this summer, but for the past year I‚Äôve been hung up on what school to pick. I‚Äôm from Houston, so it‚Äôd be a decent drive to school and home, no major air ports around the school, have better academic school options based on ratings (Iowa State, K State, etc). 

 However, I feel drawn to Mississippi State, the fierce rivalry with Ole Miss, the south is something I also find more comfortable because I‚Äôve lived it all my life, and the SEC. I‚Äôm interested in microbiology, but I‚Äôve purposefully picked schools that have stellar agricultural programs because I‚Äôd like to cater my degree towards ag/plant sciences. 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is what made y‚Äôall decide on state, it‚Äôs currently my front runner school. It‚Äôs a fight between my heart and brain, and I‚Äôm trying to find a happy medium. The reasons I‚Äôve listed are also pretty much basic surface level info, I don‚Äôt want to write more than I already have, but can elaborate if asked. Also, having enlisted from Texas, I planned on going out of state to school and returning to Texas to utilize my hazelwood act.

I was wondering if anybody had insight on how the timeslot for class registration were structured. Originally I thought that it was based on which year/division you were in and whether or not you are honors, but that doesn't actually seem to be the case. 

I am an honors sophomore going into my junior year in the Fall, and my registration timeslot is tomorrow at 3:45pm. However, I have spoken to friends who are also sophomores and in honors who had their timeslots today, at 1:45pm. I am not sure why they got to do it so much sooner, as I was cleared by my advisor to register a few weeks ago, and have had the registration checklist completed for a while. My only guess is that maybe it is based on department; for example I am a political science major and the friends I asked were both computer science. Any thoughts on the matter would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR- How does MSU structure their registration timeslots, and why was my timeslot later than students who have the same year and honors classification as I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/ty3ryw/class_registration_timeslot_priority/,LlamaLabs,1,2022-04-06 23:22:45,0,/r/Msstate/comments/ty3ryw/class_registration_timeslot_priority/

u00tfs,Struggling Freshman Aerospace Engineering Student,"I am struggling academically. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm smart enough for engineering. It takes me so long to understand concepts, way longer compared to other people. My current semester GPA is a 2.47 and I‚Äôm nearly failing some of these classes (programming with C, physics, calculus, linear algebra, chemistry.) There‚Äôs always multiple assignments/homework due each week, so it‚Äôs hard for me to find time to study and reinforce the material without cramming last minute before a test. I‚Äôve also noticed that it‚Äôs hard for me to stay focused as well. I know people say to limit distraction while studying, and I do but sometimes I just stare at the wall and zone out. I think these things make me a bit unprepared for engineering: I don‚Äôt understand material as quickly as other people do, and I have trouble focusing at times. I look at other freshmen engineering majors around me, and they seem to have it all figured out. I know some people who are doing research, being involved in extracurriculars, and taking like 19 credit hours all while maintaining a 4.0. Meanwhile, my main focus is only on my classes and I can barely pass them. If I can hardly get through the basic classes, can I even manage to get through the actual aerospace engineering classes? I feel so anxious and stressed most of the time, and I don‚Äôt get enough sleep. I‚Äôm also probably going to lose my scholarships because of my grades.

ud8b2q,New Grads! Please Avoid C Spire!,"First off, congratulations to you New Graduates!!!! Your hard work has paid off and you are about to experience the freedom of no more homework! I'm a lurker and graduated some time ago, but as an alumni I feel I must share some advice. If you are considering or have received a job offer from C Spire, please proceed with caution especially if in IT. I wanted to stay in the state with family and so took an offer from them a few years ago. While I was happy to be close to my parents, I was continually stressed and overworked while at C Spire. I get that we're a low cost of living state, but making only $60k a year as a software developer facing constant crunch is not what I went to school for. The company will work you to the bone and you will often be putting in 60+ hrs as salaried. You will find yourself working nights, on the weekend, on holidays, and even while on PTO because there's just so much work being demanded. If you're a minority, you will be belittled, ignored, undervalued, and so much more. They have recently caught flack for covering up a sexual assault and failing to uphold EEOC. There is also an ongoing racial discrimination case against them (Smith vs. C Spire) if things weren't already bad enough. I urge you to read through their Glassdoor reviews before taking any offer from them. You should be incredibly proud of yourselves for gaining an opportunity, but also recognize the traits of a toxic workplace. I don't want any other new grad to fall into the trap of their abusive work environment when there are so many opportunities out there. Best of luck to you fellow Bulldogs!

unuidf,Just wanted to rant a bit about my (brief) time as a graduate student,"Ok, this might be an odd (and very very long) post for this subreddit, but I just wanted to put it out there about my very short time as a grad student here at MSU. I just want to know if it was just my experience or if others may have felt the same way.

So for some background, I completed my undergraduate psych degree here in 2016(yep, I didn't have a graduation due to COVID and got to finish four long years of college sitting in my childhood bedroom). But I loved my four years here. Starkville felt like home, I met some great people, and I really enjoyed my program and all of the students and professors in my major. I was absolutely ecstatic to get accepted in the clinical mental health masters program here at MSU. This program was my first choice because I knew the school inside and out, I would be having friends from undergrad as roommates, and I knew the program was one of the best in the state.

I knew going into that semester(fall 2020), it would be difficult with COVID and all of my classes being online for the foreseeable future. However I was not expecting it to be as bad as it was. I had never felt so disconnected from my professors. My cohort was very close, and we communicated almost constantly, and that helped a lot. But if felt like there was a brick wall between us and our professors. Granted, I only had 2 professors that semester, so maybe it wouldn't translate to all of them in the program, but I felt like they weren't interested in teaching us. The classes were bland and stale, neither really seemed to care for their students, and once, one of them ended shouting at the whole class because we brought up a legitimate concern towards her attitude towards all 25 of us by telling us all that we needed to suck it up. I want to say I remember the word ""pussy"" being thrown out towards us. We all just sat in silence, and then she tried to carry on with the class like nothing happened and got upset no one wanted to engage with her. The same professor on a few occasions took personal jabs at students, and one I remember her saying because one student had a few grammar errors in a paper, that she'd never made it through the program and should quit now. That professor even took points off my final grade for my ""appearance."" I know we were in an online class, but I knew we'd have to have our cameras on, so I'd make myself presentable each day. I might have worn a t-shirt(nothing with a lot of writing on the front, just run of the mill shirt), but I still would wear nicer blouses and sweaters, always fix my hair, sit up straight, and even wear makeup on some days. How was my appearance below average? I learned absolutely nothing. I went from a 3.89 GPA student in undergrad to struggling to stay afloat. Granted, I had some of the worst depression of my life at the time, but even when I was extremely depressed before, I kept my grades and motivation towards school high. But not this semester. I was so passionate about becoming a counselor, but all of sudden, I hated it.

I ended up taking a leave of absence that next semester and had every intention of returning the next January after a year to recover, but I didn't. I couldn't even imagining putting myself back into that environment again. I did expect the program to reach out to me at the end of my leave of absence to ask what I wanted to do or if I even was going to return, but nothing. I reached out to tell them my decision myself and asked for any guidance if it could be given, and I never received a response. For months, and even now, I miss learning, I miss school. But I couldn't imagining going back to MSU again. I still live in Starkville, and I feel so down whenever I'm on campus(my partner is still in school so I go on campus quite a bit along w/ going to the gym) because I miss being a student, and right now, I still could have been. I felt like I shot myself in the foot by quitting, but another part of me is glad I got out when I did. I learned from an undergrad friend that was in another counseling program that this past fall, one of my two professors failed my entire counseling cohort in one class; not a single person passed, and the program had to rewrite the course track to make up for the entire cohort failing.

I'm not sure if I'll ever go back for my masters degree, even at another college (I was thinking of it when my boyfriend goes to his grad school in a year). I miss being in the classroom, and I want to be able to actually use my psychology degree and do something related to psychology so those four long years of undergrad don't seem like a waste. But a masters is needed for that.

I just wanted to know if anyone else has felt like this, especially in the mental health counseling program. Sorry for all of this, it's just with graduation season upon us, seeing everyone getting dressed up to take photos on campus and seeing everyone excited to walk, it's making me jealous that I could be having that exact experience right now if I stayed with it. Anyways sorry for the long post!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/unuidf/just_wanted_to_rant_a_bit_about_my_brief_time_as/,cea689769,1,2022-05-12 02:17:44,0,/r/Msstate/comments/unuidf/just_wanted_to_rant_a_bit_about_my_brief_time_as/

uw4hkx,Mid 20s looking for friends in Starkville area?,"I realize this is a university page, but there aren't many other ways to do this so... here goes nothing.

I'm a mid 20s female, young professional in the general area.  Rural MS is about to kill me from the lack of platonic relationships I have here. The only personal relationships I have here  beyond acquaintances are my family. The only others around my age are all the type that got married and started reproducing super early, or they tend to be the stereotypical ""small town MS"" kind of person that I've found I tend to not have much in common with (I'm talking on a surface level, like interest in music, hobbies, etc., as well as deeper stuff). I hope that doesn't sound snobby, and I don't look down on those people, but growing up in that environment, then leaving for a while and coming back... well, you realize the things you felt so strange for liking and wanting out of life are in fact, pretty normal. Being back here is messing with my mind, but I know there are people somewhere here that I'd get on with.

Truthfully, I'd probably fit in pretty well in some basic suburbia or trendy area of a bigger city (I'm acknowledging my ""basic"" nature here), and everyday I question why I came back. Anyway, now that you generally know why I'm on here seeking out friends, I guess I'll give a little bit about myself:

I read a lot, I watch YouTube more than regular TV, and I'd rather spend my money on traveling and experiences than material items (but who wouldn't, right?). I actually have a bucket list of sorts to visit various concert halls, venues, and stadiums all over the world that range from traditional music halls, to college football stadiums, to premier league stadiums. I LOVE music; in fact, a lot of my insecurity about making friends stems from the fact that growing up, I had no friends that liked music even remotely similar to mine (sorry, I just keep unloading these insecurities haha). I love alt, indie rock, and a bit of everything (though I detest most country). Some of current (and long time) favorite are Pinegrove, Phoebe Bridgers, Ruby Waters, Sam Fender, Hall and Oates, Rolling Stones, Hovvdy, Racoma, to name a few. 

Anyway, most of my friends live off in and around places like Memphis, Birmingham, Atlanta, etc., and while I do try to visit, life gets busy. I know you're probably thinking I should just move (if you've read this far), but it's complicated. So, if you think we could be friends, let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/uw4hkx/mid_20s_looking_for_friends_in_starkville_area/,AltruisticAttempt248,1,2022-05-23 12:42:55,0,/r/Msstate/comments/uw4hkx/mid_20s_looking_for_friends_in_starkville_area/

I am putting their careers website link down below. This is an awesome company and I work as a remote engineer for them. Their benefits are amazing: They offer insurance (I only pay co-pays for all my insurance types), paid PTO (which accrues), 19 paid holidays off, nice retirement options, free massages every other month, tuition assistance, and they will also help you pay off your student loans. The work environment is very relaxed as the CEO‚Äôs main priority is the mental health of his engineers, so we do not burn out.

v4v5x1,I made ratemyprofessors but for classes: Rate My Courses,"
Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/mississippi-state) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking. Also, since some courses depend on the professor, you can filter the reviews by professors and it will show you the average ratings for each professor.
Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.  (to leave a review, just search your course and you can submit a review at the bottom of the page)


Also, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this. And if anyone is interested in writing an article about this dm me!

Enjoy!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/v4v5x1/i_made_ratemyprofessors_but_for_classes_rate_my/,oopsidaisiess,1,2022-06-04 14:45:14,0,/r/Msstate/comments/v4v5x1/i_made_ratemyprofessors_but_for_classes_rate_my/

Hello everyone!

I've created a national student club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We discuss flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We are building a Wiki of many types of future tech as a resource for people looking to know more about technology. We also have plans to start doing projects as our organization gets more established. We also have guest talks from speakers who work in tech!

Right now there is no chapter being formed at this school, but we are always looking for people to help us start new ones for the next school year! Being one of our leaders could be a great opportunity in shaping your resume and in making connections! We also welcome anyone who just wants to join for our discussions.

We have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! If you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!

You can also visit our website below for more information.

Plus my office on campus has been &amp; always will be a dead spot where Wifi Calling has been a lifeline.


I've seen AT&amp;T regarded as very solid in Mississippi, so I had always wanted to go to Cricket and call it done, but Google Fi has some extremely enticing promotions for new customers. $299 for a Galaxy S22 with Google Fi is leaps and bounds better than buying unlocked flagship phones at full price on our own (we wouldn't be getting budget/mid-rangers), or getting overpriced generation-old flagships from Cricket.


Anyone have any first-hands opinions on how Google Fi has been for them coverage-wise around Starkville and/or surround areas?  Specifically that first stretch of Alabama on the way to Tuscaloosa/Birmingham?


In theory it should be fine between T-Mobile/Sprint/US Cellular coverage, especially if Google Fi will use T-Mobile's extended range bands -- 12/71/77 (600/700MHz).  Also I saw suggestions that C Spire is part of the coverage in other threads, but it's hard to find any confirmation or info on that.

w7b40e,Social Campus Rent Question,"Hi. I feel like I should just call them, but I wanna know others' experiences with them as well - lol. 

I've recently signed a $660 X 10 months there and I'll have to pay an amount of $1980 as a security deposit. So in total for the first month of August, I would pay $2,640 (660+1980 duh). However, I'm charged $2,740 dollars (an extra $100).   


I have 2 ideas according to my lease of why I'm charged with this extra 100, but not entirely sure which possible reason. What do you guys think?   


1. Creating a new account fee ($100) &gt;&gt; Most likely and easiest reasoning (Fingers crossed)
2. My lease is 10 months instead of the ""standard"" of 12, thus shorter. The big question is here. Do you think because my lease is shorter and quote, ""there will be a monthly short-term premium of $100.00 that is due in the addition to your monthly rent"". I really hope this isn't the case because then I'll pay a ""rent"" of $760 instead of $660 per month. This is from the ""Short Term Premium Addendum"" (pg 45). I think this is specifically for people who are living maybe for 2-3 months or something. Idk tbh. 

Generally speaking, does anyone have here been charged for #2, and do you mind explaining your situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Msstate/comments/w7b40e/social_campus_rent_question/,Remarkable_Lynx_5076,1,2022-07-24 21:01:18,0,/r/Msstate/comments/w7b40e/social_campus_rent_question/
w871gb,Freshman Anxiety,"This probably sounds super paranoid but I‚Äôm coming in as a freshman and I have very odd questions (at least, according to my standards) that I would be embarrassed to ask anyone I know sooooo yeah.

1. I‚Äôm living in Griffis, which people say is carpeted. Do I need to bring a vacuum? My old school was tiled and we had access to the school mops and stuff to clean with, but I doubt college is the same.

2. How far is my dorm building from central campus spots like Perry, the Drill Field, the Junction, things like that? Is it easy to walk to? Do I need a bike? Will I actually eat at the caf or Union often if it‚Äôs so far away?

3. I tend to cook a lot - what do I need to bring to cook with? 

4. If I don‚Äôt have a car, how often will I need to Uber places?

5. Is Starkville Uber safe?

6. How many counseling sessions will MSU give you before referring you to someone outside of the health center.

7. Where‚Äôs the most affordable place to go for dental/vision work? Do we have anything on campus to take care of that? 

8. Where‚Äôs the best place to go if I happen to need puppy therapy one day? 

9. I‚Äôm pretty mid-sized, but not very active. Will the on-campus walking be enough to either keep me in shape or keep me where I‚Äôm at now?

w917tz,Creating a successful resume,"This is a throw away account just to post this.  

First off, right off the bat, I must say I am not selling anything and I certainly don't want any contact info. I just wanted to share (see below google drive link of¬†*free*¬†resume/cover letter and interview tactics files) what I learned from one year of job searching and going through the daily, arduous ordeal that is crafting resumes and networking online.

This is the exact process for how I landed a role, finally, with a job I like.

Just in time for graduation and/or summer break :)

Whether looking for an internship, your first career job, or¬†*actually*¬†good tips for interview tactics, this guide and embedded files are something I wish I had when I was in university and on the job hunt.

Because let's be honest, in all our schooling, NO ONE EVER TAUGHT US HOW TO DO THIS AND IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT! Am I right?? Yeeesh.

Anyways, below is the resource-filled link and practical advise that is an accumulation of all my personal research and assistance from job coaches ($1500 total spent there, yikes!), and the resumes I edited for my colleagues (once I figured out the formula), complete with notes on how you can do it, too.

(They all got jobs as a result, btw. One friend, I kid you not, had zero interviews in 6 months then had 3 in one week after following this ressume formula and other methods. Could have been a fluke, but I'm just saying this method works. No promises of course, but its genuine).

It details how I got recruiters' attention, networked online with people who had the role I dreamed of, and, most importantly, includes a¬†*jaw-dropping*¬†resume/cover letter format, as well as interview tactics, cold outreach email templates, and modules that someone sent me that contain practical tips and tricks for how to get that coveted role:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM\_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM_)

It's my goal to help ease the anxiety and stress of this process for all those students who may be actively or passively looking for a job and need help standing out from the pack.

As mentioned earlier, trust this oft-rejected fool that this resume format is¬†*perfect*. I know this because I tried many, many other formats and this one was the one that landed me and my colleagues roles¬†*much*¬†quicker and added a ""WOW"" factor to it.

**Some additional notes on resumes:**

1. Usually keep it to one page.
2. Keep the format and font the same as these examples; just put in your information. I included other CVs to showcase a variety of roles/careers. I think there is some formatting errors on a couple resumes, but you can fix those. I saved them as Word files so they are editable. :)
3. Believe me when I say numbers mean everything in a resume, no matter the industry. So put them on as many bullet points as you can. Hiring managers¬†*love*¬†that. Which is better? ""responsible for managing team and hosting meetings"" or ""managed team of 20 coworkers, whose combined sales reached 112% quota"" See what I'm sayin?
4. Keep this bullet point format: Past tense verb (created, developed, etc) ---&gt; number ---- result number. Every bullet point, or as many as possible. Search resume verbs in google for ideas, or use the ones in the resumes provided.
5. Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? Just want to hammer that home. As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the ""vague description"" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this, in my experience, and the resume will never get looked at, I can darn near 100% promise that.
6. Inverted pyramid style: Chronological order, most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order. This looks good visually and they mostly care about what you did most recently anyways.
7. Write a¬†*bad ass*¬†description of the company you worked for, right under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just¬†*what*¬†that company does, if it isn't obvious.  
This is¬†*KEY!*  
Ex: ""Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America."" See how much better that is than just the name? You feel the difference?
8. Numbers below ten, spell out. All others just write the number. Instead of exact numbers, when they get too big, write a ""+ after the rounded number (ex: ""157 employees ---&gt; ""150+ employees"") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital ""K"" for thousand, ""M"" for million (ex: $23,800 ----&gt; $23K+; $5 million ---&gt; $5M)
9. Exectuive summary also has numbers and must be¬†*bad ass*. No more than two sentences. See examples.
10. I changed all the names in the resumes to protect the innocent :)

**Notes on how to find jobs/ grow network:**

Please, please,¬†*pleeeeeease*¬†don't waste your time applying to LinkedIn or Indeed posted jobs. 99% chance it's a waste of time. I sent out 500+ resumes like that over the course of a year and got one interview from it.

Total fail.

Now that I work for a large company, I see just how true that is. We did a hiring spree at the beginning of this quarter and every single one of the new hires was a referral.

Every. Single. One.

Companies just post those because they ... have to? Not really sure, but again, this is my experience.

I can't stress enough how important it is to get an¬†*in*¬†at a company.

So how do you do that if your network is small, just starting out, or you dont have any friends (like me! lol)?

Get your LinkedIn up and going - this is super important because its the first thing hiring managers look at.

If you have exhausted all your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want, try this LinkedIn approach (the modules in the link also have other methods outside this one as well):

What I did was paste my resume info in the description field on LI, added a nice photo and background, and added a ton of people from realtor groups (they always accept requests) to get me to the coveted 500+ connection badge and make me look suuuuuuuper cool. (LI has a limit to the number of adds a day, so will take a few days to accomplish this).

I then sent DMs to people in a role or company that I wanted to work for. It went something like:

""Hey (name)- I'm a (junior, senior, grad student, etc) at (uni name) and I just wanted to say that your job at (company name) seems like the dream role I'm working towards! How do you like it?"" People are flattered you like their role, and it opens the dialogue up for more conversation, which is when you later ask to speak with them about the company in a call or over coffee (more details on that in the link).

Use the free site [hunter.io](http://hunter.io/) [violanorbert.com](https://violanorbert.com) to find anyone's work email to send cold emails to (email templates in the link).

\------------------------

Look, I have a history of mental¬†health issues and the the job search used to make me super depressed back in the day. I totally get it.

I don't want that for¬†*anyone*.

You all should be spending time studying and not re-doing your resume for zillionth time.

That's why I took the time to make this guide.

I want the process to be as easy as possible for¬†*everyone*¬†and for¬†*free*.

I'm sure your university has a Career Services department, but I can almost guarantee their resume and tips ain't as good this.

Anyways, best of luck to you all in getting that scholarship, internship or first job that sets you ever so slightly faster on the path for career success!

Let me know in the comments if this helped.

The Career center helps make contacts for jobs, build resume's, assist you in practicing for interviews and has a good deal of research material for the companies you'd like to work for. 

Trust me, this isnt some useless thing the university provides. It can make all the difference in the world no matter how close you are to graduation. 

Sincerely, 

A grad who got his 1st job out of college with Ferguson Enterprises in 1995 because of the MSU Career Center

Hey there,

So I'm stuck in Starkville for the next 2 years and I'm bored out of my mind. This is a bit of a stretch, but is there anyone around who might like to hang out? I'm looking to make friends. I'm a gamer, I like music, and I love to read.
