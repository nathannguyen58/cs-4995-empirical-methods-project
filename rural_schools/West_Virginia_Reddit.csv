bmporo,I just have some questions about my first semester at WVU this fall.,"So I'm really excited that I'll be attending WVU this fall. Morgantown was just an awesome city and I really loved what the school has to offer me. I look forward to spending my college years there. However I have a few questions/concerns that I'd like some feedback on. So firstly I attached a sort of mock schedule that I created. I'm pretty sure it includes all the classes I need to take my first semester, It comes out to 21 credit hours. Which is a shit ton, and I'm kinda concerned that I'm gonna want to blow my brains out. I guess the simple solution would be to take less classes but I don't think I have that option. I'm taking the engineering track 1 courses and in addition I also have my ROTC requirements and my Honors requirements. The way that the engineering department made it sound is that I have to go along with the ""First Year Experience"" that they have set up. That entails all the classes and what not. I considered dropping Honors since I wont even be living in Lincoln or Honors Hall but my parents and siblings all suggested that I don't. I cant drop ROTC either as I got a scholarship through them and that is the only way I can afford school. I guess I'm asking if there is a way around taking all these credit hours or if not, is there anything I can do to ""ease my suffering."" Secondly, if I have the time, is there any ""social"" things y'all would recommend doing. I guess such as a Fraternity, or a club sport. Are these things worth it to do? Lastly and most undeniably important, why is there no Waffle House in Morgantown? Whats wrong with y'all!

bmvovg,Question about instruments in dorm,"Some background story: I just finished my last day at Pierpont and I’m transferring to WVU by next semester. Still awaiting to get accepted (should be fine - I got accepted after high school last year and I did well during my year at Pierpont), but I’ve been looking about housing options. I’m planning on living in a single room/suite (what is the difference) at the Bennett Tower because of my Music Industry major. I’ve stumbled upon the “what to bring” page and saw that “Use of subwoofers, drums and amplified instruments (e.g., electric guitars) is not permitted, but these items may be stored in a student’s room provided such equipment does not disrupt the residential community (items may be confiscated if they present a disruption to the residential community).”

Obviously I’m not bringing my amp to a dorm. I only planned on bring my bass and guitar up so I can continue recording my music and such (and who knows - might actually need it for a class) Obviously my instruments would not even be amplified unless I had an amp, but all I would be doing is playing them through an interface for my laptop which ONLY goes to my headphones. I think I should be fine but I was really worried if it would be able to work out. A friend of mine (who’s already there) knew of some people bringing their trumpet, flute, etc. (which are even louder) to their dorms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/bmvovg/question_about_instruments_in_dorm/,JLX9,5,2019-05-10 04:19:51,11,/r/WVU/comments/bmvovg/question_about_instruments_in_dorm/

Does parking and traffic get significantly worse during graduation? In the other college towns I've been in during graduation traffic is a nightmare.

But without any warning that this was an issue, I was dropped from Calc 3 yesterday, assuming because I don't have Calc 2 completed. This is *extremely* inconvenient because it delays my graduation an entire semester. I admit I probably should have checked on this, but since the system let me do it, I figured it was fine.

cas75l,I am currently freaking out about this Fall . I don’t know what’s going on.,"I’m at work right now and it’s going slow so I was checking my email . I was notified about Math 128 and how because of low enrollment my section had been canceled. Which was a hassle but I was fine with it. 

So upon trying to register for the same class again it’s showing that I don’t meet the prerequisites . Which was stressful but doable , it would have been a setback but I understood that sometimes things work that way but that it’d most likely be handled 

But then I checked my academic records to see if it was a transfer credit issue and now it’s showing NONE of my transfer credits and is showing me enrolled as a freshman when originally I had 34 credits transferred over and had me as a sophomore.

So now my stress level has gone from 0 to 4000 .  I have earned these credits over the last 2 years and have planned the next few years  with the idea that I would be attending and completing my bachelors at WVU at a certain time . I’m hoping it’s an error or some issue with STAR and that I’m not being screwed over .

cf4nix,Questions for WVU Musicians living in dorms,"Made a post a month or two ago about bringing my guitar(s)/bass(es) to WVU considering the rules, but since I plan to record/practice with my headphones and not be a disturbance, I should be fine. I was hoping to live in a single at the Bennett Tower.

https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/bmvovg/question_about_instruments_in_dorm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Anyways, I got lucky and ended up with single, so I have a room for all and only my stuff. This works out for me as I have my own privacy to record and practice without bothering everyone or people bothering me. However, I’m debating whether or not to actually do it at my dorm. I only live 45min away, and my dad only works a couple miles away from Bennett Tower anyways so it’s not like I’ll be far away from home and barely visit. I was set on recording stuff in my downtime up there and figured this become needed in some form since I’m majoring in the Music Industry. However, based off some posts I’ve read on Reddit about bringing instruments, it might not be a good idea. I use two guitars and one bass for recording my own stuff, and use another bass for practicing/playing my band’s stuff. That ends up being a total of four instruments I would bring to my dorm. I own two guitars that are $400 Squiers, one bass that is a $700 Fender, and another bass that is a $500 Jackson. I also use an interface and an Akai Pro MPX Midi Controller. They’re not extremely expensive, but very nice instruments that have had work done to them and overall just sentimental to me. Even though I am going to live in a single, I still worry about the risk of things getting stolen.

If you happen to be a fellow musician that resides/has resided at the Bennett Tower, I need your help. My question is, for musicians who were/are in a similar situation as me, did you happen to bring your musical gear with you, or did you leave it at home? Has there been many reports of theft with the Bennett Towers or other WVU dorms? 

I figured I ended up answering my own question midway while typing this, considering I have an easy and reliable transportation system with my dad and could just plan to record on the weekends when I would come to visit. I might be too busy with homework and I also plan to get out more during my downtime. I could probably just bring my midi controller with me to create ideas and what not for recording, then finish everything at home. Plus, this also would help me not get distracted potentially.

Although I’m majoring in the Music Industry, and not a musical performance major necessarily, I want to jam with people up in Morgantown if the opportunity awaits. I don’t know how often I will need perhaps my own instrument for Music Industry classes (only 1/3 MI classes are not online). People have told me about the practice rooms at the CAC. Apparently it costs $90 to rent for an hour or so, that’s what I read so I might be wrong. Do they provide amps or instruments there, or is it basically empty and you just bring your gear? I figured maybe I could take my bass/pedalboard/amp up on some weekends whenever I find somebody who wants to jam. I also could practice in my dorm with headphones connected to my interface without using my amp so I don’t have to pay for anything if I decided to do anything up at WVU.

Although I wasn’t planning this, I’m figuring it would be a more practical option and I wouldn’t risk my instruments getting stolen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/cf4nix/questions_for_wvu_musicians_living_in_dorms/,JLX9,3,2019-07-19 03:44:05,4,/r/WVU/comments/cf4nix/questions_for_wvu_musicians_living_in_dorms/

cgliib,No Job Experience and Lost,"I am a transfer student from Pierpont Community College and have finally enrolled into WVU. Yes I know, it’s somewhat embarrassing, but I never had a job in my four years of high school. I am not looking to get a job immediately during my first semester, but I know I want to start providing for myself soon and would like to get prepared. I am going to live in the Evansdale area (Bennett Towers) and would like to get an on-campus job, so it is close and easily accessible. I can’t drive yet (looking to soon) but it’s not like I’m going to need a car anyways for my first year in Morgantown. I am a Music Industry major. I have done extracurricular activities in high school such as concert, matching, jazz, and show choir band. 
I have downloaded Handshake as well just so I could browse and get an idea. If there aren’t enough campus jobs that could apply to me (it doesn’t have to be music related at all, I just listed what I’ve done in high school, if it helps), I guess I could find something somewhere else in Morgantown, I just want to not worry much about transportation. 


This is the first time being on my own and I am basically lost, trying to figure things out. I know I’m basically coming from a middle class family and am grateful I never had problems within my life, but unfortunately living in this “sheltered” lifestyle for most of my life leaves me to feel like a fish out of water.

cn83n1,WVU JOB ALERT! - Brand Ambassadors Needed in Morgantown Thurs the 15th and Fri the 16th,"HELLO WVU! I know this isn't generally a job posting board, but I need some locals and thought y'all would be a great fit!

I am staffing three **STRONG** and energetic brand ambassadors to wear backpack billboards for a street team taking place in Morgantown, WV!!!

**DATES:**  
THURSDAY, AUGUST 15 - 10:30AM - 4:00PM  
FRIDAY, AUGUST 16 - 10:30AM - 4:00PM  


The first 30 minutes of the shift is built in time to gather supplies and prepare to work, followed by 5 working hours, with two 15 minute breaks included.

These billboards are big and weigh 22 lbs, so you need to have a strong core and be capable of wearing them for the entire shift without complaints. You cannot take them off or set them down, and no extensive breaks are provided - only two 15 minute breaks to run to the restroom, grab a snack, etc, that will need to be staggered with the other team members so that the TL can hold your supplies while you're away.  


The job will consist of walking in a route around WVU, popular stores and restaurants, distributing flyers for a furniture store, being friendly and personable. Be prepared to walk 2-3 miles total throughout the shift.  
Dress code is khaki pants, khaki shorts or blue jeans, and your own plain, solid color, short sleeve shirt with no words or logos, worn with clean, neutral colored (white, gray, black) tennis shoes or sneakers. No athletic pants, sweatpants, leggings, etc. Client may provide t-shirts, tbd, but please ensure you have the above required shirt in case they do not.

Compensation is $150 for the billboard wearer (5.5 hour shift time, but actual working time is 4.5 hours considering a 30 minute prep time and two 15 minute breaks built in). Paid out in 2-4 weeks via W4 and direct deposit.  


We also need one on-site Back Up each day. You would come dressed, prepared, and willing to work the full shift as a billboard wearing Brand Ambassador, but if you are not needed, you will be released within 30 minutes. If you are released, this pays $40 for coming as Back Up. If you are needed to stay and work, you’ll earn the full BA rate for the full shift.

To apply, email Work@GoGorillaMedia.com with a recent headshot, as well as a full-length photo, and include your resume or promotional history and a phone number where you can be contacted for an interview. Please put “Morgantown WV” in the subject line.   


Please specify which dates and positions you're available for. Preference will be given to anyone able to take on both days.

Thing is, the email address used by Mr. Turiano is different than the one listed on WVU's directory. That, and the email is written in times new roman, but his custom footer is in a different font. 

So the question is, does anyone in the psych department know if this is a legit thing? I feel like if I email the guy (especially this late at night) and I happen to be wrong about this, he'll think I'm an idiot and shit. If y'all know someone who received one of these emails last year or received one yourself, replies to this post would be absolutely wonderful. Thanks so much.

What I am getting at is I really like WVU as a whole I think we have the best school pride in the nation and am super excited to start my first year in college here.

First of all, I live at West Run apartments and I don't have a car, so I have to take the bus wherever I go.

On Friday it runs from 7 am to 2 am and on Saturday it runs from 9 PM to 2 am? and it doesn't run on Sunday at all. The main problem for me is that I have to go downtown every Sunday for my meetings &amp; I don't have transportation. I don't want to shell out $10 for an Uber or Lyft there because i'm a broke college student. I also have classes on Monday and Friday that last until 8:50 PM so I need a ride back to my dorms then. 

At the very least, Does anyone here live at west run or someplace near that can provide me with scheduled pick up from Evansdale to West Run apartments every Monday and Wednesday after 8:50 PM? I understand if this is a weird request, but I am just trying to save money. I may be able to provide like $3 a week for gas if needed, but thats about it.

czd30j,Help with finances,"So I am writing this because I was dropped from my classes and don’t know what to do.

I talked to those in the aid office and they said that as long as I go and fill out the agreement and come back they will reinstate my classes. I logged on to my account earlier when I spoke with the attended and it stated that my net balance was $3,000.  As in I owed that money or it wasn’t paid. Well, logging in several hours later, my balance is now $-10, 458. I did complete the remaining agreement in that time span. My question is that does this mean the loan went through and I should go back and talk about reinstating my classes, or does it mean something else completely, and has the deadlines for loans already expired, and if so, should I just pay the $3,000 out of pocket.

dfhwlv,Business Insider wants to know what a day in the life is like of a WVU student,"Hello everyone!

I’m a reporter at Business Insider and I’m reaching out because I’m working on a project right now that I thought could be of interest to y’all. We are reaching out to students all around the world to see what a day in the life is like for students at different schools. This week, we’re focusing on West Virginia University. 

The project would involve **taking 15 to 20 photos of your life at WVU** and submitting them, along with brief descriptions.

Are you a student doing something unusual that you think more people should know about? Do you know of any hidden gems or strange places on campus that deserve more attention? Do you often find yourself caught in funny or unexpected situations? Do you know of any scandals or bad behavior on campus? Are you a regular at some of the school's wildest parties? Are you an athlete? If you can answer yes to any of these, we’d love to hear from you.

Please reach out if you have a compelling story idea about college that you think could be told through a photo series. We are **offering $160 to anyone we decide to publish** and we are open to keeping these anonymous if necessary. Hope to hear from y’all. Thanks!

(Please email or text me if you’re interested)

The Side Pocket in the basement of the Mountainlair is relatively unused &amp; seems like a good spot for an open mic. Me and a few of the officers in the WVU Guitar Club have some basic equipment that can be used to set up a basic open mic consisting of one vocal mic and one or two instrument inputs through an amp (We dont have a PA system). Another idea that we had in mind would be the Ballroom on the upper floor of the Mountainlair. I think it already has a PA system in place &amp; it seems more practical than the Side Pocket, but other activities may occur there during Up All Night on some nights. I want to try and make it a weekly, if not a bi-weekly event at Up All Night. 

I want to try and schedule it as a separate event from Up All Night, since I was told that events for Up All Night must be submitted a year in advance (why?). But overall, what do you all think?

They are all theater kids and late nights at the CAC during the week are probably going to be pretty routine, so shuttles that end at 9 pm do them no good (but then again, parking after business hours is probably much easier at the CAC, so probably a wash.) 

These kids have stars in their eyes about amenities. I'm trying to steer them away from nickel-and-dime places, places that have caps on utilities (like the Lofts), places that don't include utilities or have other not-so-obvious fees.

Lofts, Domain, University Commons (on the river/rail trail), Pierpont Place, am I missing any obvious ones? The closer to Evansdale the better, and yeah, I know Lofts and Domain aren't, but they're still interested. 

I've seen some sweet actual houses for rent, but I also heard that there are laws against too many non-related people. Anyone know specifics of where that applies? Is it everywhere in M'town?

Thanks very much for input.

g61d07,Is parking a problem at WVU?,"Hello guys! Since the last year, I’ve been working on a project to address the parking problem at universities. I’ve developed a business model that provides a solution to the problems I identified at FAU, the university I went for my bachelors. Later, I realized from talking to students from other Universities, that the problems are present in most of the largest Universities in the USA. Below is what we heard the most from other students:

Every semester students face the same problem; having to arrive at school 45 minutes to one hour earlier just to be able to have time to find a parking spot. It is a real hassle being able to find a parking spot and it becomes frustrating and stressful. 

A group of friends and I decided to continue with the idea and er committed to solving the problem by designing a solution to help students and faculty to find parking much faster. So, to help us better build a solution for the students and the schools, we are asking students at various Universities a few questions about their experience when parking at your university campus. We would appreciate your help with this! We are on the way to developing something GREAT for the infrastructure, not only for one university but for all other universities in the United States.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.

It is a Google Forms format, and it will only take you **1 minute!**

**Thank you!**

Is the audition process the same procedure and/or at the same time as the concert band auditions? And if it isn't, what would an audition for a non-major entail?

Finally, how much of a time commitment would you say a Jazz ensemble is? And is a non-major going to be able to keep up in skill with the jazz and music majors?

But I need to know whether or not I should go to this university because of what I want to major in.

The degree that I’m most interested in trying to get is computer science because I love what you can do with coding.

I have some questions though.

How is the curriculum for computer science?

How are the clubs for Computer Science?

How hard is it to get an internship at WVU for computer science?

If you can answer just one, it would help me out a lot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/gfzbfi/help_me_decide_whether_or_not_i_should_go_to_wvu/,jdywood,1,2020-05-08 15:04:32,26,/r/WVU/comments/gfzbfi/help_me_decide_whether_or_not_i_should_go_to_wvu/
gg66c2,Tips and Advice for WVU '24,"With the current circumstances, most of the incoming freshmen in the class of 2024 did not have an opportunity to visit/tour campus in-person in the spring or see anything in-depth at WVU. Not only that, New Student Orientation as well as multiple summer programs have been cancelled or moved into an online format.

Building on the assumption and the hope that students are returning to campus in the fall, I invite any current students, faculty, and alumni to give any type of tips and advice that they learned during their time at WVU. I'm creating this in the hope that as incoming freshmen try to find more information about the school online prior to move-in, they will receive real advice and tips that isn't covered with any ""fluff"" coming from the school and its officials.

I am aware that freshmen could easily create a thread here or dm any questions to community members (which they are still free to do so!!) but for the sake of any duplicate questions asked and for convenience, I'm hoping to put everything in one thread and in one place. Let's be supportive and helpful, everyone.

So I'll start.

First tip: Don't get Starbucks gift cards for the Barnes and Noble Cafes in the on campus bookstores, they don't work because they are technically not Starbucks cafes. Instead, get Barnes and Noble gift cards for these places.

Second tip: Don't wear your white freshman lanyard around campus. You've probably heard this many times, but it had to be said again lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/gg66c2/tips_and_advice_for_wvu_24/,CaptPolaris,1,2020-05-08 21:30:40,41,/r/WVU/comments/gg66c2/tips_and_advice_for_wvu_24/

gk2f8l,Looking for a 4th roomate!,"Hey all!


Me and 2 of my friends are looking for a 4th roommate at a house we are renting for the 20-21 school year. Move in date is July 22nd. 


The house is 3 floors, 4 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms and rents for $525 a month not including any utilities. Includes a 2 car garage and 2 street parking spaces at no extra cost. Has a fenced in backyard with a fire pit and a room with a pool table. It's a really cool place! Must have a $500 refundable deposit at signing.


It is located near Evansdale and is within walk to the Engineering school, Law School, football stadium, Kroger, Towers/Oakland, etc so if you don't have a car it wouldn't be too much of an issue.


My roommate Nathan graduated a year ago and currently works in the finance office at WVU. He has a dog who would be living with us as well!


My friend River is taking classes next year, is in the Army reserves, and also has a full-time job.


I just graduated this semester with a Political Science/Religious Studies dual major and a minor in Philosophy. 


If you are interested or want more info about the place or us, please feel free to DM me. It would be awesome too if you could tell me about yourself and maybe link some social media of yours.

gmr0le,Online MATH156 during the Fall Semester,"So I'm still trying to sort out my schedule (since I couldn't get into a few of the classes I need) and the current schedule I have is all Evansdale classes, except one class downtown MWF - MATH 156. There is no instructor assigned to any of the math sections. It also only gives me 30 minutes to get on the PRT, arrive at the Beechurst Station and get to Woodburn Hall on time; it is doable, but the time table is tight.

All of the sections of MATH 156 on Evansdale do not fit the schedule that I currently have and it is extremely hard for me to switch around since I made it into two classes that have no seats open and cannot really switch it in the first place. There is one online section of MATH156 open, and it is for the full semester. Has anyone had experiences with this online math class for the fall, and share any advice about it?

I am still considering any and all options that will not require me to use too much public transportation during this coming semester due to the current situation we are all in, and right now this downtown math class is throwing a wrench in my otherwise decent schedule.

gy69hx,Legality of electric bikes?,"Hey comrades,
     I will be coming to WVU this fall for a PhD in computer science and was wondering if I could use an electric bike for my commute. The information on the internet is very conflicting. These are the three main opinions:

1. Considered as regular bikes.
2. Could be considered as mopeds and need to be registered with DMV.
3. Completely illegal?

Could you give me any advice ? Does any one of you own one in WV?

hbr62w,Tips and Advice for the Class of 2024 - Part 2,"Hey everyone!

So as NSOs are underway and many freshmen are posting schedules here, and as the school prepares for quite an *interesting semester*, I have decided to make a part 2 to my original ""Tips and Advice"" thread, oriented towards freshmen coming to the Home of the Mountaineers. Welcome home!

Obviously, some of these tips may change as new COVID19 measures are put into effect on campus, but they relatively will be markers of the freshman experience.

**Optional:** If you are giving advice, feel free to state your major/(degree for alumni) that you are studying so that freshmen can DM you about major-specific classes if needed. You can also state the dorm building that you lived in freshman year if you are open to answering dorm-related questions! For example, I am an engineering major who took most freshman engineering courses required for freshman as well as gen eds, and I lived in Towers on Evansdale last year!

So I'll start off with an FAQ here from the previous thread to avoid too much repeated info:

**What should I do about Welcome Week?**

Obviously the Welcome Week schedule is still in the air for the most part, but definitely attend whatever events that are scheduled. Many Welcome Week events are oriented towards freshmen so take advantage of it and meet as many new people as you can... errr, remember to social distance of course. Worst case scenario, get to know the people in your dorm too, they are a valuable resource and I made friends from the dorms my freshman year.

**Is my schedule okay as a freshman?**

General rule of thumb is that 12-15 credits is a GREAT schedule for a full-time freshman. Obviously this will change depending on Honors and major requirements, but don't overstretch yourself past 17-18 credits (looking at you, overachieving Honors kids with 19 credits). Even that would be quite hard as you will need to make the transition to both your classes and your new responsibilities as a college student. Only take what you can handle first semester. If there are questions about specific classes, feel free to DM me or someone within your major.

**Will I make it to my class on time from Downtown to Evansdale, or vice versa?**

Currently public transportation options are under review at WVU, but generally the rule is to leave 30-40 minutes to take the PRT to account for wait times and constant breakdowns. With the social distancing protocols, keep in mind this time frame may need to be longer. The school has mentioned increasing the number of buses traveling between campuses (free with WVU ID!) so leave 50 minutes for the line and the inconsistent bus schedule, from my experience. 

**Do I need to buy textbooks?**

No, not yet! Don't buy any textbooks until the end of the first week of class. Professors know that the bookstore gets busy and people will switch in and out of classes left and right on the first week of class; they will not require textbooks during this first week. They will tell you if you need the textbook for their class during this time, however. Believe me when I say this, renting will ALWAYS be better than renting if possible.

**I'm interested in trying out this activity, but it doesn't match my major and I don't want to be judged for it.**

Lucky for you, here our marching band is called the Pride of West Virginia. Yes, people cheer for marching band here! Don't be afraid to try any new clubs or activities, even if it seems intimidating at first or ""only for upperclassmen."" There are clubs within majors, and there are also general clubs (such as sports) open to all majors. Try to go to at least 3 meetings (virtual or in-person) or attending a club event outside of that meeting before committing to the club/activity and paying dues mid-semester, if any. 

**Man, this looks like a really hard class on my schedule and I don't know the professor teaching it.**

Be sure to look up professors on [ratemyprofessor.com](https://ratemyprofessor.com)! It is a valuable resource for students, especially freshmen. (I wrote all my reviews on that website for all the professors I took last year) If they aren't found, definitely feel it out the first week to see if you need to switch sections. Don't be afraid to meet people in your class, whether it is in person or online. (I am taking an online class now and I made plenty of new friends on it) You can form study groups or figure out homework assignments together. There are also plenty of tutoring resources on campus when you get there, so don't be afraid to make appointments online to use those. Professor's office hours are also important to attend if possible because they will get to know you and help you out beyond the general lecture in their class. There are plenty of resources to use on campus and they are there to help you succeed.

**I am still unsure about what to major in.**

And that's okay! Most freshmen come into a major unsure about where they want to go with it, and many people switch majors during their college careers. As a freshmen, focus on finishing the general education classes and keep in touch with your academic advisor. Don't feel pressured about your major because most majors will keep you in introductory courses your freshman year (In fact, engineering doesn't allow you to declare a discipline until sophomore year, or whenever you finish the freshman engineering program). Keep an open mind, and pursue a major for the right reasons - your passion, your interests, and where you want to be after college.

**I won't be bringing a car to campus, but how can I travel off campus without one?**

Parking passes for a car are a pain (trust me on this one. Plus, Officer 69 will be on the prowl for parking as it is). But anyways, since you wouldn't have a car as a freshman, the Mountain Line Transit is the main bus line used, and your WVU ID is your pass. Look them up and save their bus lines and schedules to see where you can go. There are buses that travel downtown, buses that travel to Westover, buses that travel to Towers, and buses that even go to Pittsburgh, among other bus routes. Save these for future reference. Note that with the current situation you might need to call and make appointments to get a bus ride to wherever you need to go. Try not to travel too much on game days, however. Traffic is a pain in the ass during those times.

**Do I need to go to class?**

Yes, yes you do. Often they are part of your grade, and there were some classes I had that offered bonus points or in class assignments for attending class. Attendance policies have become more flexible this semester and are subject to change, but that doesn't mean to skip classes anyways. Often lectures contain valuable information needed for at least completing homework assignments.

hl3b64,Need a final roommate in a 4 bedroom/4bathroom west run apartment,"So long story short, my friends and I (all guys) have lived at West Run since 2018 in a 4x4 apartment and unfortunately one of my roommates is now trying to sublet his lease so he can move in with his gf that he’s known for 6 months. Its a great deal excluding the fact that its off campus. Rent is $330/mo, the place is furnished and parking, wifi, cable and water are free. There’s also a bus route to west run that takes you downtown on campus. 
The reason i’m making this post is because I would like some input on who his replacement will be before he finds someone without consulting us first. Feel free to DM if you need a place or if you know anyone that needs a place this coming fall. The lease begins the second week of august i believe (i can double check)",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/hl3b64/need_a_final_roommate_in_a_4_bedroom4bathroom/,siceboi,1,2020-07-04 09:27:56,0,/r/WVU/comments/hl3b64/need_a_final_roommate_in_a_4_bedroom4bathroom/

With all the students contemplating take a gap year and with the ever increasing chance that there will not be in person classes this August, the number of people trying to get out of the leases they signed before the pandemic really had any impact is only going up each day.

I would really appreciate not having half of the sub being ""take my lease"" at any given time.

hyzeqv,Q&amp;A THREAD (7/27): WVU announces phased return to Morgantown campus,"After consulting with local and state public health officials, we have decided to implement a phased return to campus for students this fall on the Morgantown campus.

Classes will now begin August 26 — a week later than originally scheduled. Some professional programs may have alternative start dates.

Please read [President Gee's letter](https://presidentgee.wvu.edu/messages/phased-return-to-morgantown-campus-july-27) on our Return to Campus site where he details the factors in making this decision, as well as some of the updates that have been made to academics, housing, testing, student services and fees, and December Commencement.

If you have any questions about things that were not covered in the letter, please ask away and we'll answer as many as we can. We might not be able to get to all of them right away and, as always, the situation can change frequently, but we'll do our best to get an answer for you as quickly as possible.

We'll continue to have more information about details for the Fall 2020 semester in the coming weeks as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/hyzeqv/qa_thread_727_wvu_announces_phased_return_to/,OfficialWVU,1,2020-07-27 15:48:29,60,/r/WVU/comments/hyzeqv/qa_thread_727_wvu_announces_phased_return_to/

i09ijm,WVU needs to make a serious statement on the consequences for large parties.,"The only way I can see WVU staying open for more than a few weeks is if the school can keep the parties under control. However, I have seen no such statements. It’s going to be extremely frustrating as a freshman to see parties of 20+ people on my story knowing that there will be know consequences. 

I’m not sure what jurisdiction the school can take for off campus parties or gatherings but realistically that will be the prime reason we’ll see COVID cases spike if we go back to school. I believe that the only way this “phased re-opening” can truly work is if students who participate in behavior that goes against public health policy to face serious academic punishments or outright expulsion.

i18swo,Question About Moderation,"Friendly neighborhood moderator Anger here. 

Hope everyone is staying safe out there. 

Just checking in with the community about the recent (and in some cases not-so recent) influx of cases related to the University and their response to COVID-19. I, as well as the other mods, am really trying to stay out of threads because limiting conversation is not something we're interested in. We've locked a few threads recently because they've kind of gone off the rails. 

To that end, is there something that you wish/want the moderators to do differently regarding posts about COVID-19? Keep in mind that your suggestions (if you make any) might not be instituted, but it might help to have some other perspectives so that instead of guiding the community on our vision (the moderators), we can guide the community based on what the community wants. 

We'll still delete posts that don't pertain to WVU and lock threads that have devolved into internet shouting matches, as well as take action against posts that violate ToS. Another thing I've been thinking about is political posts. Voting season is upon us, less than a hundred days to election day now, and I've seen an uptick in posts about candidates. This certainly affects WVU but may not necessarily relate the university. 

Just looking for some input to make sure we're on the right path.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/i18swo/question_about_moderation/,TheAngerOfPanger,1,2020-07-31 10:50:31,28,/r/WVU/comments/i18swo/question_about_moderation/

So, i’m a transfer student and very first semester at WVU was supposed to be this fall, however with everything going on I decided not to go this year. I thrive in an in person educational environment and refuse to pay 70 grand for a year of online school. So can I just defer my enrollment? It says on the form online that first time freshman can defer enrollment for a year, does that also apply for transfer students? Also it says that if you do fill out this form and push your enrollment a year, that you can’t take classes at another institution, which is a problem cause I was planning on taking some classes at my local CC just to keep in the student mindset. In this case what do I do? Just withdraw and try to get a refund on my deposits, and re-apply next year?

i5g4sg,Widespread Moderator Accounts Hack - Notice,"Several large subreddits have been targeted by a coordinated and widespread moderator account hack. So far, /r/WVU remains unaffected but the mod team will continue to monitor the situation and repair issues should they arise. The attack changes the subreddit styling, locks the subreddit, and modifies the robot overlords I mean automod. 

In the meantime, you can follow two basic steps to ensure your account is secure: 

**1** Enable 2FA ([instructions here](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043470031)). A good way to secure account is to at least use two of these: 

* Something you are (iris, fingerprint, or the the thickness of your thighs from climbing the LSB stairs), 

* Something you know (password or the specials every day at Backdoor), 

* Something you have (phone for 2FA authorization or a burning hatred for Pitt). 


**2** Use a unique password for all of your accounts. A good password uses a variety of letters, numbers, and symbols but it doesn't have to look like a tiny fairy drunkenly did the electric slide on your keyboard. I personally use the [xkcd method of password generation](https://xkcd.com/936/) along with their accompanying [password generator](https://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator/) to create unique, complex, easy-to-remember passwords for sites I commonly use. For others, I use a password generator and password manager (LastPass and Keepass, for instance). 

Stay safe out there, my dudes. Please report any suspicious activity to your nearest lampposts (but not the ones on Walnut, they work for the bourgeoisie).

i7ew8t,Spread of COVID,"I am concerned about the lack of information we have for if one of us actually tests positive. What will the living conditions be like in Arnold Hall? Also if it takes 3-7 days to get results back, the people that are positive will be spreading it around like wildfire until they know they have it. I understand they said to quarantine until we have results, but using the bathroom and going to get food will simply be enough to expose a hundred students. 

Will there be a statement concerning this issue? Also will the students testing positive receive a type of refund for classes and dorm? Surely they aren't thinking that online classes should be the same price as in person. Dorms are more than the cost of classes, how will they makeup for the lost time in our dorms while quarantining in Arnold? Will there be an option to go home if tested positive instead of staying in Arnold? There are multiple strands of this virus, what will be stopping students in Arnold from catching another strand of the virus?

i7ywp1,Campus Response to Covid Compared to WVSU + Flawed Testing,"Incoming freshman here. I am absolutely baffled at the University’s response to the COVID pandemic, as most of you are. I have two friends who just started at WVSU, and I think their school is doing a much better job of handling this and WVU could definitely take some notes. For example, here are some of the precautions they are taking:

-students must have a negative result BEFORE coming to campus, not testing on move in date and “self-quarantining” for a week. I lucked out and move in a week before my classes start, but what about the people with in person classes who move in two days or three days before class start who have in person classes? Accommodations must be made for them, but it would have made the process a lot easier if students had a positive test result within a week or two before the move in date. People are going to come to campus positive with COVID, and have no idea for 3-7 days. 

-before entering every building, students are screened for temperature and receive a sticker showing they have no fever. If students don’t have the sticker they must be screened again. I know this would not translate well to WVU’s campus because of the immense difference in size, but how about a screening before students leave their residence halls in the mornings? In the latest email sent the University stated they are going to monitor students through daily self reported surveys, which serves the same purpose, but I know there will be students who lie to keep going out and do whatever they want. A screening station in every residence hall, with a temp. check required to leave would be far more accurate and allow students to check up on their own time as part of their morning schedule before classes. Students could leave the sticker on their shirt (about half an inch in circumference) with their temperature and if they lose it, go to a testing station at another hall or maybe have some set up around campus as well. 

I was screened at WVSU about a week and half ago and it took about 15 seconds. Maybe having a screening station at the entrance to every building could reduce congestion, but seriously? Getting results after students have moved into the dorms, (I’m sharing a bathroom with 3 other people, and they are only being deep cleaned once monthly. I feel for people who have communal bathrooms. Hope you pick the stall that hasn’t been contaminated yet). People are going to mingle. I’m being placed in a room with another person I don’t know is negative or positive. If he is one of the lucky few who show up to campus positive, not knowing because he was tested when he got here, I am basically guaranteed to get it. And then I have to self isolate for 14 days in a run down dorm complex, even if I do the right thing and hide away in my room while awaiting my negative result. 

To me, this system is heavily flawed and seems to show care and concern for students and staff, but there are more and better things that could have already taken place to reduce spread. I think the reason behind this is that the University accepts they will go online eventually, and want to get meal plan and student housing payments before they do. 

Now, I have been to campus once. I barely remember how it’s laid out and I live in a really small rural part of WV. I’m not used to or really been exposed to large communities like this, so if any of this doesn’t make sense, that’s probably. 

Sorry for making this post so long, it kind of turned into a rant, but don’t you think there are better precautions that could have taken place?",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/i7ywp1/campus_response_to_covid_compared_to_wvsu_flawed/,PacoTheTacoII,1,2020-08-11 16:00:48,12,/r/WVU/comments/i7ywp1/campus_response_to_covid_compared_to_wvsu_flawed/

id067o,What to Expect Fall 2020,"Classes began at WVU Tech today and it was total chaos and disorganization. If this is the standard for reopening within the WVU system, every student at Morgantown should be very concerned. The administration has no clue what is going on--there is absolutely no leadership. Students are confused, lost, and disoriented because the admin is failing to give us real information.

For starters, mass testing began last Tuesday and lasted until Thursday. When classes began today, Wednesday, a large amount of students still had not received their test results back. We were told to go to class, even if our tests had not yet been confirmed negative or positive. This applies to all faculty as well--there are already major problems here. What was the point of testing?

Disorganaztion was a constant theme throughout the first day of classes. Most classes that have more than 20 people in seat have been switched to hybrid. So, when most students were expecting in-seat classes--they showed up to class only to be told it was to large and had to swapped to hybrid. On the first day of class, the majority of students I talked to only attended one in person class if that--even if their schedule showed fully in-person lecture the night before. 

In my case, I never received my Covid results back. All my classes got changed to a hybrid today expect one. The hybrid lecture for one of my classes never even happened because the professor could not figure out how to work Zoom, even though the admin has had all summer to prepare faculty for online classes. I honestly have not seen any noise, talk or complaint about this much online--so I am posting here to warn of the sheer carelessness that WVU officials have about their students. I can say, the students were disoriented, confused, and outraged by the reckless planning of this semester.  Today showed every student at WVU Tech and in the WVU system are being used as cash cows. 

If we are going to have classes changed to hybrid, we should be informed and notified at least a week prior. Not on the first day of classes! WVU's leadership is reckless, incoherent, and meant to bring chaos by changing classes on day of.

I don’t know if you all care about this as much as I do, but if I was in a dorm I would want to know if the person living right beside me has COVID! What makes this worse is the fact that not only do most dorms have shared bathrooms that the quarantined students use, but there is barely any circulation in those buildings. It’s not a mystery WVU is only keeping us in person for money but this is the highest level of scum I’ve heard of this semester.

iktmyi,An Alternative Perspective...,"I've been keeping my mouth shut on this sub due to the instant downvoting of anything that is against the group opinion here, hence why I'm posting this with a throw away account. I understand the recent posts about going home due to rising COVID numbers, and how angry some of you are, I understand that. I can see why you're concerned. I especially feel for the freshman, as they have been made to come here due to the promise of in-person classes. However, any comment made about choosing to be here despite COVID has been met with criticism and disrespect. 

Here goes the unpopular opinion:

Some of us want to be on campus despite COVID, honestly we're not that horribly concerned about it. Yes it is a nasty disease for some, and I'm not disagreeing with that at all. But for most people, COVID is not a death sentence. I want to be on campus, and seeing everyone asking to go home is deeply saddening. We're all about equality, it's one of the core values of this University and is what makes me proud to be mountaineer. So, with that said, why should one group have to suffer because some want to go home. It should be up to one's personal choice to want to live here and go to class. I want to go to class despite the risks, I want to live my life. We sat around for 3 months already, some of us are ready to move on with our lives. If you don't want to go to class, that's fine, sit in your dorm and stay there and take your class on zoom. If you want to go to class, go to class. I shouldn't have to live in someone else's fear. I know the risks, I'm willing to roll that dice. If it's as bad as they tell you it is on the TV, no amount of masks, distancing, hand washing, or anything else is going to prevent it from spreading on campus. I choose to be in class, I'm well aware of the risks, let's get on with class. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, I shouldn't be shamed for wanting to hang out with my friends who I haven't seen in 6 months. We're all adults, we all agree there are risks, so if everyone wants to be there so be it. Letting the university tell me what to do in my own house isn't something that's on my radar. If I'm not breaking any state, county, or local laws or decrees from the governor on group size, what goes on in my house is my business. Just like a employer can't turn you in for public intoxication in your own house, as long as you aren't blasted at work, it's none of their concern.

il9l47,Gee just sent a statement out...,"To the West Virginia University and Morgantown Communities:

I am aware of the photos and commentary that are circulating on social media showing West Virginia University students gathering outside local bars in downtown Morgantown. To say that I am disappointed would be an understatement.

With the opening of bars, it was anticipated our students who are of age would be patrons. But the lack of following safety protocols – including not wearing masks or following physical distancing guidelines – is a flagrant disregard for our community’s safety, both the campus community and the city of Morgantown.

Faculty and staff at West Virginia University have worked tirelessly all summer to bring our students back to campus this fall. We heard the many voices – of both students and parents – who wanted us to open campus for learning. We created a plan to do so, and following a spike of positive cases in July, the University quickly pivoted to reduce capacity on campus while incorporating additional safety protocols to keep the community safe.

We have been transparent with our Return to Campus plans. Expectations were clearly defined and shared – repeatedly – with students and parents. We emphasized that each of us would have to be accountable, respectful and responsible for each other and for our individual behaviors if we wanted to have a successful semester.

I am proud of those students, faculty and staff who are demonstrating our Mountaineer Values every day. I would estimate that 90 percent of our campus community are doing the right things to stay safe and healthy.

But, as always, it is the actions of a few that bring negative attention to our University. However, during this time of a global pandemic, these same actions lead to more than unwanted headlines and social media shaming. These actions will lead to serious consequences including additional community spread of COVID-19 and the closing of an on-campus learning environment.

To the Morgantown community, we will continue working with our students to stress the safety protocols. We will identify as many students as possible that are not following the guidelines and refer them to Student Conduct for appropriate discipline. I assure you we are taking these incidents extremely seriously. And we will continue to partner with the City of Morgantown and the Monongalia County Health Department to keep our community safe and healthy.

To our West Virginia University community, we must continue making the right choices on campus and off campus. Follow the safety guidelines – wash your hands, wear your mask, physical distance at least 6 feet. Avoid large gatherings. Hold yourself and others accountable.

And remember why you are here: to receive a valuable education that will influence your future for decades to come. Do not squander the opportunity you have before you for a fleeting moment in a setting that is dangerous to your health and the health of the community.

This is a critical moment for West Virginia University. If we want to continue on-campus learning, we must make the right choices. We must make the important decisions that lead to responsible action. To do anything less will most certainly lead us down an irreversible path.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't necessarily disagree with his words. Yes, Students should be more responsible. But I have two responses to that, first, we knew that wasn't going to happen. We saw that a week after the university closed down in March, a block party that UPD had to break up, that these kids weren't going to follow the rules. This means that the University had a responsibility to plan for this. And I don't mean reaction punishment, I mean taking the loss and going online. Second, they knew in March that COVID wasn't going to go away, and that it was going to get worse, rather then better. Even if you take the partying out of the equation, the disease still was going to spread (Note: WVU admitted this, they said that they were prepared for some students to get sick.) Though, they tried to use their predicting powers, and were hoping that the spread would be low enough not to worry about. 

He can be angry all he wants, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the university is seventy percent of the blame.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/im0zds/oped_students_need_to_acknowledge_their_own/,Jackstack6,1,2020-09-03 16:03:01,10,/r/WVU/comments/im0zds/oped_students_need_to_acknowledge_their_own/

imkr5a,Taking A Walk Outside,"Hey all. I know with everything going on, a lot of people are not wanting to be out in public. Since many students don't have cars, and want to avoid crowds, it makes shutting yourself inside seem like the only real responsible option. I would like to take a minute to really advocate that everyone go outside and take a walk, and breathe some fresh air without fear. 

But where can I do that you may ask? 

I would like to let everyone know about [Falling Run Greenspace](https://fallingrun.wvu.edu/), which is a good sized park/trail, right down the hill from Oglebay Hall downtown. I hike there every evening, and I seldom see anyone else there. It is in walking distance of all of downtown, and right next to the bus stop at B &amp; E. I feel like nobody even knows the park exists, and that is a shame, cause it is a nice quiet area to clear your head right in the middle of town.

Taking some time outside, getting the blood flowing, and having some free space is really helpful in these times. I'll be honest it really helps me personally at least. Please just remember the old adage of hiking ""Take only pictures, Leave only footprints."" (It is very clean for a public park and I rarely, if ever, see any trash).

You have no f’ing idea what we’ve all gone through to prepare for this semester. NO IDEA.  I started in June making preparations for my courses. Can’t tell you how many University level, college level, departmental levels we’ve had discussing all our changes for fall. All of the endless emails from the university promoting online tools and teaching strategies. All the anxiety, late nights I’ve had just to get to this part of the semester, early as it is.  All these summer evenings and days when I could have been w my family enjoying the summer.  All this work we’ve done and it is so easily dismissed by you guys here. “Gee, they never really prepared or planned things right”
Yeah, well Fuck. You. 

Yeah...our mistake was we fucking thought you’d take this seriously. We fucking thought you’d have an ounce of responsibility during a pandemic. But “they should know we want to party” “well we can’t go to the football game so we just have to party to make up for it”

I know not all of you have made stupid fucking choices like these idiots who party under quarantine. Hopefully it’s just a fraction of you. But right now I am pissed at the student body.  If you are a student of mine, you wouldn’t think this was me because I’m known as a friendly enthusiastic prof. I’ll hide it when I have my Zoom class tomorrow.

Recently, I’ve been looking into all the threads about WVU and have not been as excited as I initially was to transfer. I know Covid is making a huge impact on the world, especially at universities- though I am curious to anyone’s thoughts of what Spring semester will be like? 
Currently, I am out of state and doing my courses online till my transfer. I am worried that when I do transfer I will be surrounded by many individuals who are reckless during the pandemic. 
I love being able to get to know people, and my dream job is to work with NASA (one of the main reasons for my transfer) but I feel (based off of other threads) that the student life isn’t going to be as welcoming as I hoped for/ I will have a difficult time being able to truly experience college. I am also worried at the lack of precarious being done, as well as most classes being on campus.

So, if you’re at all interested in helping prospective students learn about WVU from a safe distance, then please keep reading!

What is this site?  CollegeVizzy, a social media-esque platform that aims to improve the college application process for students who, for any reason, lack the ability to visit college campuses in person.

Cool; how?  In a nutshell, CollegeVizzy supplies a space where college students can make prompted social-media style posts about their college campus—and where prospective students can compile and share notes and impressions of universities they’ve visited.  The end result, we hope, will be a resource that provides a somewhat more comprehensive look at a given college than a virtual tour or an Instagram page might otherwise by itself.  And right now, more than probably ever until this point, high school students could use as much information as possible to learn about the schools they are considering. 

Of what concern is this to r/WVU?  Well, good ideas aside, CV still needs a solid, content-creating user base.  That is where you can help.  If you’re interested in making an account and sharing ~stuff~ about WVU, the link is below.  Everything is free, there are no ads, we sell no user data, and making a post will enter you into a giveaway that we’re running for a $150 Uber Eats gift card. 

Tell us anything!  Show us your favorite places on campus, your dorm, or whatever else you’d want prospective students to know about.  If you have any questions about the site or about posting, or any feedback, leave it down below.  I didn’t want to make this post unbearably long, so if there’s anything that doesn’t make sense or isn’t clear I would be more than happy to follow up in the comments.  Thanks!

“We are pleased that the measures we’ve taken will allow us to bring students back to the classrooms,” [**Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Maryanne Reed**](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprovost.wvu.edu%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cd80fd756e57f46f91ede08d85feca226%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637364817214795447&amp;sdata=N3fvKwQ6bG2dGaixh%2B7x4k7Z4wTluJZatJB%2FjdGP7ss%3D&amp;reserved=0) said. “Now we can move forward with our original plan for delivering high-quality instruction, regardless of modality, while also giving our students an on-campus experience.”  
 

In-person instruction for undergraduate students was canceled and a temporary shift to online learning was [**announced Sept. 7**](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwvutoday.wvu.edu%2Fstories%2F2020%2F09%2F07%2Fwvu-moves-undergraduate-classes-online-through-sept-25-on-morgantown-campus-reduces-in-person-activities&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cd80fd756e57f46f91ede08d85feca226%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637364817214805440&amp;sdata=SW%2F6W9uv5ZcMaMehyxDmmkz3etHeg2F9IuJ1E3bBcRs%3D&amp;reserved=0) in response to an increase in positive cases in students, as well as concern about a potential spike in cases following several reports of parties held over the Labor Day holiday weekend where groups should have been in quarantine.  
 

The University and Monongalia County health experts have closely monitored a number of factors during the two-week pause. Positive COVID-19 tests in the county are trending down, as is the Rt rate.  
 

“The student daily positive case numbers are down, including those tests conducted outside the WVU system,” [**Dr. Jeffrey Coben**](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirectory.hsc.wvu.edu%2FProfile%2F28812&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cd80fd756e57f46f91ede08d85feca226%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637364817214805440&amp;sdata=BuAaCCgU%2F08l8YsQ2a0fRWkAYFE%2Fx1yS%2BJ3F4OoKjuY%3D&amp;reserved=0), associate vice president of health affairs and dean of the [**School of Public Health**](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.wvu.edu%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cd80fd756e57f46f91ede08d85feca226%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637364817214815431&amp;sdata=89Ybjzp2kbyBvnJNk3wfz9MCMoWeBYg0AohaEAk72Cs%3D&amp;reserved=0), said. “Additionally, we have seen consistent declines in student quarantine and isolation cases.”  
 

Arnold Apartments, WVU’s designated isolation space for residence hall students, has a 40% occupancy. And the local hospitalization rate is low and includes no students.  
 

Since return-to-campus testing began on July 20, WVU has seen just five faculty and staff positive cases on the Morgantown campus - none found to be from a classroom or on-campus exposure. The University’s [**data dashboard**](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wvu.edu%2Freturn-to-campus%2Fdaily-test-results%2Fmorgantown&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cd80fd756e57f46f91ede08d85feca226%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637364817214815431&amp;sdata=i%2Bso6l2AX7boPde%2FF3RytoRU39sTr8GNgAhW8NenopM%3D&amp;reserved=0) is updated weekdays at 2 p.m.

“I understand when students are hanging out with their friends off-campus it might be easy for some to let down their guard but it’s so important to remember the safety guidelines all of the time,” Farris said. “I am so proud of the overwhelming majority of our students who understand they need to wear a mask, practice physical distancing, avoid large indoor gatherings in social settings and follow the rules so we stay here on campus. And we will continue to hold those who are not following the necessary guidelines accountable for their actions.”  
 

According to the latest information from the Office of Student Conduct:

· Approximately 120 students have received, or will receive, COVID-19-related sanctions, up to and including probation

· 30 students have been placed on interim suspension pending hearings

o 24 students have been suspended

o 3 students have been placed on deferred suspension

o 3 students’ sanctions were reduced to probation after their hearings

· 14 students are awaiting possible hearings

“I want to thank the Governor, the National Guard and the Monongalia County Health Department for working with us to offer free community testing at the Student Rec Center,” Alsop said. “This testing is available every Wednesday for the forseeable future to all WVU students, employees and residents of Monongalia County and it is not necessary to have COVID-19 symptoms to get tested.”  
 

The University will continue to conduct testing of students who are symptomatic, as well as those who may be at a higher risk for exposure. In addition, faculty and staff who are working on campus and are concerned they may have been exposed can also receive a test upon request. More details will be available later this week on the process for doing so.

“Every decision we have made has been focused on the health and safety of our faculty, staff and students,” Gee said. “We were able to flatten our numbers and move forward with the semester. However, we are still in the midst of a serious pandemic and must adhere to the safety guidelines in place. Going forward, I want to assure our campus and the surrounding community that health and safety factors will continue to guide us in the future.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/iyfolx/wvu_to_resume_inperson_classes_after_temporary/,EnterTheMunch,1,2020-09-23 14:17:54,40,/r/WVU/comments/iyfolx/wvu_to_resume_inperson_classes_after_temporary/

j0h1m3,Planning on changing from EE to Music Industry. Not sure what to do right now,"So I’m in EE and I don’t like it. I realized as soon as this started how burnt out I am in math and science. I’ve had it shoved down my throat by my parents since I was a kid and I’m smart enough to do it, I just have no desire to. I picked EE to learn about sound and how to make guitar pedals and effects and stuff, but I quickly realized that’s not it at all.

I’m pretty sure I want to transfer over to Music Industry. I emailed my academic advisor earlier today to schedule a meeting. I have a few questions, though.

I haven’t looked at the requirements for music industry. If under 12 credit hours worth of my current classes don’t transfer or count, what’s the point of being enrolled this first semester? I have calc, chem, Econ, eng101, engr101, and engr191, and honors orientation. I’m behind in all of these classes since I’ve felt really lost with my goals for school. If I don’t need or can’t use at least 12 credit hours worth for the music industry degree, what’s the point in staying enrolled? 

I also saw if you wait to withdrawal completely after 60% of time has passed, you don’t owe back any money. If I left right now I believe I would owe back. 

I honestly wish I took a gap year, and I’m even considering dropping out completely and doing it.

I have promise, the pell grant, wv higher ed grant, scholarship of dist. 1, and I don’t want to lose any of these.

If anyone has any advice or recommendations I appreciate it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/j0h1m3/planning_on_changing_from_ee_to_music_industry/,PacoTheTacoII,1,2020-09-26 20:16:37,15,/r/WVU/comments/j0h1m3/planning_on_changing_from_ee_to_music_industry/

Hi guys - back in July, I posted a survey about the coronavirus on various college subs. I got almost 500 responses and recently wrote an article summarizing the findings. There were so many excellent responses it was hard to pick which ones to highlight, but I tried my best to capture the trends I observed. Since a good chunk of the responses came from students in this sub, I thought I’d make an update post (all in all, I’d say about 25 universities had high levels of representation in the survey, so I’ll be making update posts in those particular subs).  

Thanks so much to the people in this sub who participated! This wouldn’t have been possible without the help of student redditors. If any of you have questions, feel free to PM me.

They have had a proverbial carrot on a stick put in front of their faces as the financial aid office said to set up a payment plan for the entire amount with the promise of being reimbursed later on.

The financial aid office then said they sent a check in the mail but that check was not received and nothing showed up in star.

She is taking what online classes she can, but three of her classes are partially or fully in person and there is nothing she can do about that. She is at the mercy of the university and her professors, neither of whom seem to care that their peers and/or students (as well as anyone who they come into contact with in their daily lives) are in danger of potentially permanent health complications or death from COVID-19. I am very concerned for her safety, mine, and for the safety of our families as well as that of Morgantown, West Virginia as a whole. In my opinion, this decision is extremely unsafe and far removed from the reality of the global health crisis we are facing. If you share my opinion on this matter and feel inclined to do so, I would like to invite you to send the attached letter in the form of an email to those responsible for the decision to resume in-person classes:

right now, i'm a freshman living downtown in a double and i'm thinking about getting a single, one bedroom apartment for my sophmore year. vandalia apartments has peaked my interest, as it's super close to downtown (where i want to stay) and a couple of my good friends are thinking about getting a two bedroom apartment there as well. i love my roommate now, but i think it'd be really nice by myself.

i don't plan on bringing a car or anything since i don't have my license, so i mainly thought living downtown would be convenient. also, all of my in-person classes are in evansdale at the CAC so i'm hoping the coach busses come back next year but we'll see about that. i love those busses !! 

(ALSO if getting an apartment by myself seems like a hassle and getting a single dorm would be better since i don't have a car please let me know! i've been thinking about both options)

but the most important thing for me is to be able to stay on campus and be in an area i'm familiar with, as well as being able to have a space of my own. i'd like some reassurance from someone about these apartments though and get thoughts on them as well! thanks so much. :-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/jkkofs/thinking_about_apartments/,frisaki,1,2020-10-29 18:47:30,3,/r/WVU/comments/jkkofs/thinking_about_apartments/

I’ve been Struggling with newfound depression and anxiety the past two years and I’m finally taking steps to get over it. I’m in therapy with the Uni and I’m starting to feel better! I exercise nearly daily and I eat way more than I have (in a day) in the past to years— I went from built and muscular to skinny and barely any muscle then to skinny fat and now I’m getting back to my built ole muscley self. I have fun with and by myself now and *I enjoy time spent with me* which I’m so grateful for. It’s been tough. 

I wish there was a way that my profs could know that I’ve been trying my mf damnedest, in my own way. And that I’m seeing the results of my labors (academically) and it’s not what I want it to be at all.

I don’t want to be a 6th year senior. I feel like that would be such of a let down knowing what I can do and who I can be. 

I just want to be it..

Any advice? Is it too late in the semester? What can I do? I feel like I need to learn the whole semesters worth of information for 75% of my classes because I just cannot seem to get what I’m supposed to even be learning. This pandemic bs is awful.

jr99uw,Anyone else find Math 150 this semester to be a total mess?,"It might be my schedule personally and know that this whole semester has been a mess but for the love of god my math 150 course takes the cake on this. They throw more busy work than what’s it’s worth; I’ve been doing fine on the exams but the damn homework is ridiculous. Since I have classes conflicting with my required TA hours, they add an extra lab on top of it every week.
I’m not the one to complain but I’m extremely dissatisfied with how the math department treated this particular course this semester. It’s a little discriminatory to those who already have a busy schedule IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC.

The classes keep filling up every time I've tried to register, and I REALLY need to register for this class (required for my degree) because if I don't take it in the spring, my graduation will be delayed by a semester.

I posted a few days ago about joining the honors program, and based on my own interest, as well as the positive feedback I heard from that post, I went ahead and applied. Because of this, I've put housing on hold. I had decided to live in Stalnaker, put now that Honors Hall is an option, I was hoping I could get some opinions about which one is better!

I mainly liked Stalnaker because the exterior of the building looked super cool, and I liked that it overlooked downtown campus. I also thought the amenities seemed pretty good, since it has AC, unlike Boreman S, and is so close to the Mountain Lair. I've heard that Honors is supposed to be one of the nicest halls though. No matter what I would be looking to get a double suite, if that makes a difference. Is Honors hall so much better than stalnaker that I should wait for my potential acceptance to Honors to apply for housing, and how integral is Honors hall to the Honor's program?

ki6ya2,Apartment Help/Recommendations,"Hi everyone!

I was wondering if anybody could give me some insight into apartments near WVU. I expect to move in before the Fall 2021 semester so I'm trying to figure out where I would like to live now.

I'll be a Nursing major so most of my classes will be downtown my first year. I hope to work at Ruby while I'm studying at WVU. I wouldn't mind having roommates and I would like to keep my rent below $650 a month.

I've had a few places in mind, such as The Ridge, CEV, and Chateau Royale. Could anybody tell me if any of these three places are no-gos or if they're not too bad.

If you have any other recommendations of places to live, I would love to hear them. I just feel completely overwhelmed because I feel like there are literally so many places to live in Morgantown.

It’s a remote work opportunity, simple to get involved, low commitment, and easy way to make some extra money. CollegeHush pays you $16 for 40 mins of honest conversation, you get paid for referrals, and you get matched with prospective students. Here’s the link if you’re interested in signing up to be a mentor:

Preparing to graduate this upcoming fall semester from my community college. Considering following in the footsteps of my family members and attending WVU. What are my chances of getting in?

1) Letters of recommendation should be solid. I have made connections and professors have offered to vouch for me if need be, so I should be doing this during next semester. 

2) GPA (if mathematics spares me) should be high enough when applying. I currently sit at a 4.0 and made president's list and honor's society. 

3) Never took the ACT or SAT because I went directly to community college. I would be a transfer student when applying, so I should not be required to show results of test scores. Will not sending in scores lower chances? 

4) Volunteered throughout high school but have not done so in a hot minute. Will try to find some volunteering opportunities before applying, but if COVID keeps up, those plans might be vetoed. Will this lower chances?

I haven’t really looked at psychology much since other than self-studying the CLEP exams for PSYC 241 and EDP 101 and SOCA 101. I did fine on all of them, but it’s been a while. I was just wondering if anyone has taken this class and could share some insight to it.

kxmpj1,Application Question,"Backstory:

I applied to WVU fall of 2019 and was accepted. I did not attend however, because I was accepted to a very competitive and prestigious military college. Fast forward to today, I have since dropped out of that college for various reasons, one of which was for academics. My GPA was roughly a 1.9. I know for transfer students, admissions say that they require you to have at least a 2.0. Considering that my previous college is extremely difficult and “Ivy” league in terms of academics, do I still stand a chance of being accepted? I had a 3.9 GPA in high school, so would that help me at all?

I applied in November and WVU received my transcript about a month ago. Online however, it says that it takes up to 3 weeks to hear back about your application status.

I’m a student from Washington University in St. Louis. At WashU, I am a member of a non-profit organization called Heart for the Homeless. One of our projects is to create resource guides which contain low-cost healthcare options and other vital medical information that we share with clinics and the people we meet at homeless shelters. Please check out our website and [success](https://sites.wustl.edu/heartforthehomeless/national-primary-care-resources-project/npcr-project-success-stories/) stories to learn more about this initiative.

If any individuals or student groups at WVU are interested in getting involved in our project, we would love to have you join our team. We have worked with over 30 cities and would work with you every step of the way as you make resource guides for parts of the Morgantown area.

As project lead, I will be able provide you with specific instructions, templates, and other important information that should streamline the process of making a resource guide. This is a great opportunity for pre-meds (especially during the pandemic), not to mention a great chance to address a pressing societal issue. Please check out our [website](https://sites.wustl.edu/heartforthehomeless/) for more information about Heart for the Homeless.

I've researched a lot about CS and what it is etc, and I've come to terms with the fact that I would necessarily not love it all the time, but I would never hate it (might be biased since I've never taken it and have only researched).

And of course, with that research, I've seen plenty of people say how rigorous the major is. 

So my question to people who are in the CS program currently or who have taken it, how many hours a day did you study.

Are there any variables to it like the classes you have for that semester?

What was the most you had to study each day for a certain class?

There is no waitlist function for this class, no tracker, and I have requested for overrides multiple times with the same reponse ""we can't over enroll an online class"" (eyeroll) Already went to advisor, department heads, deans, professors, and I'm sick and tired of hitting constant dead ends because no one is willing to take on my case. So I'm reaching out to anyone who is taking the 7D2 class for summer 2021 - is there a possibility any of you could please take this class another semester, and could I have your seat? I am at my wit's end with this class, and I really hate asking like this. But I'm desperate, and I really would like to keep my engineering degree and stay at WVU. Please let me know. Thank you for your time. If I can't get in this class, well - it was fun at WVU while it lasted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/mlc8mu/to_those_taking_engl305_7d2/,CaptPolaris,1,2021-04-06 09:57:18,14,/r/WVU/comments/mlc8mu/to_those_taking_engl305_7d2/

mm1oc3,Looking for another roommate at Upark,"Title says it! There's two open rooms, and I'm looking for a guy preferably. Extremely done with dealing with girls in general.

Also play video games and hockey :) I don't care if you smoke or drink either. I'm just generally pretty chill and I'm trying to avoid having two 'randoms' placed in the apartment. Too many bad experiences at this point.  
Looking for guys because I'm tired of my female roommates getting offended by me just asking them to take the trash out they haven't taken in two months. Sigh. Also I'm trying to get my emotional support cat paperwork accepted, so you can't be allergic.

Another thing I would like to know is how is the city of Morgantown. I’m a guy who just loves to be outside and just enjoy nature and meeting new people. Is this a good school for that! I really wanna get to enjoy the college life but while also exceeding in my school work.

I feel like this is a school you can easily get lost at but I feel like you can say this about any other school. But this one just feels more bizarre to me as I always hear it get called as the “number 1 party school”.

mu4n34,Prospective Transfer (Current Freshman) With Some Questions,"Hey y'all, 

&amp;#x200B;

Like the title says, I'm thinking about transferring out of the school I'm at now (Mizzou), and perhaps to WVU. I got in last year as a high school student and visited campus and quite liked it, but I didn't get too deep into learning about the school because I committed very early in the year to Missouri. But the last year has been really tough and I think I want to be somewhere else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I could probably get answers to these questions on the school's website (and I'll look there too) but I want to hear people's experiences, so what I'd like to know is: 

\- My majors at the moment are journalism (specifically sports journalism) and sociology, what are people's experiences like with those programs? Would it be easy enough to balance the two courseloads / schedules if I kept those majors? How are internships and study abroad?

&amp;#x200B;

\- I don't know how to drive. Could I get around campus and town easily enough by just walking / taking public transportation? Mostly my concern here would be with getting groceries / essentials and going to trails around town. Although if it's possible I could learn to drive once I get there.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Does the University have clubs / services for LGBTQ students? Have people had good experiences with them? Same goes for Jewish organizations.

&amp;#x200B;

\- How prevalent / 'necessary' is Greek life? I'm not terribly interested in joining so I hope it's not seen as necessary to have a good time.

&amp;#x200B;

\- If anyone played club rugby there I'd love to hear how it went. I played for some of high school and would really like to play in college.

&amp;#x200B;

mvfx1w,Looking for a roomate,"Hi, my fiancé and I are looking for a roommate just to make our overall rent a little cheaper for our next May-May lease.

The place is right next to Jones place, so its pretty close to downtown, like a 5-6 minute walk to campus.

Rent would be $250, plus money for electric and the water bill. So overall, it won't be more than $300 a month.

Are these neighborhoods near campus &amp; quiet &amp; safe? I would strongly prefer quiet/less rowdy neighborhoods.

Now that we've been in the pandemic for over a year, I'd love to get your guys' feedback once again. The first survey was largely about the difficulties of adjusting to the pandemic, while this one is focused more on how the pandemic has impacted mental health and mentorship, as well as whether you feel that your campus is supportive of students who want to pursue independent projects (e.g. startups, creative endeavors, on-campus initiatives, etc.). All responses are anonymous (no personal info is collected) and you can opt whether to have your responses included in the write-up. 

If anyone has questions, please feel free to ask. And if anyone wants a copy of the raw data when it's ready, PM me and I'll add your name to the list.

Tonight I went to Los Mariachis over by the baseball stadium, Target, and all that. After dinner I went behind the building to take in the absolutely spectacular view of the city, when a truck with like 6 or 7 dudes riding in the bed pulled up. They all hop out and a couple of them proceed to walk over toward the drop off and just dump their trash down it. Here we are living in one of the most naturally beautiful states in the US, and right at one of the best views in the state, and these assholes are dumping their garbage down the side of it. 

Now I try to mind my own business most of the time, but this was unacceptable. I asked them what the hell they were doing and they just said “I don’t know what you’re talking about” and then turned around and laughed at me. 

I tried my best to pick up their garbage, but most of it had fallen down the side. I was fuming at this point so I looked at their truck and saw WVU stickers and a big frat sticker - I think Sigma Chi?

What do you think I'd get in scholarships?

\- 3.91 unweighted GPA

\- haven't taken the SAT yet but my pretests all put me around the 1300 range

\- extensive (350+) high school reading list

\- won 4 playwriting local comps, a Scholastic Art &amp; Writing silver key in poetry, and an honorable mention in novel writing

\- EC's include 3 years of choir, 2 years and 2 summer programs of acting in theatre (all of which I played a lead), 3 directing credits in theater, filmmaking classes, a key player in MUN, church groups/volunteer-type stuff, and 3 years of art classes. (all of these say three years bc of covid.) I also self taught myself guitar and piano and am pretty good at those.

\- dual enrolling at community college next year for everything except math

\- got into the St. John's College summer program (only accepted 50 ppl this year)

\- I'm homeschooled so idk if that matters. The middle schools in my area were a lil dangerous so my parents decided to pull me out and it just worked well.

\- Some other schools I'm probably applying to are UVA, UNC Chapel Hill, Pitt, and possibly UMD, W&amp;L, NDMU, and Emory &amp; Henry.

I'm currently going into my third year (starting in August) at the Uni of Central Florida and I'm looking to transfer. I see that US News ranks WVUs economics program as top 100 in the country, which is far better than UCFs unranked program (presumably). What is the program like? Is there undergrad research? Most importantly, what are the networking and career prospects like? My biggest concerns are affordability (which WVU should be ok) and setting myself up for the future. I want to go to grad school for econ, I want to work in research and really go far in the field. I know that WVU is a great engineering school but does this future success extend to economics?

Hi, I didn't realize that parking permits were already sold out for Fall semester, so I wanted some suggestions on where I should park given my current schedule. On Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays I have my first two classes in downtown, and then have to go to the Evansdale campus within an hour. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have my first class in the Evansdale campus, and then have to get to downtown in 45 minutes. Based on this information, could I get some suggestions on where I should try to park? I'm thinking maybe I should just find a spot in both Evansdale and downtown campuses to park in and alternate them depending on my first class, and then take the PRT to get to the other campus, but I was worried about that since I've heard that delays and temporary shutdowns of the PRT weren't uncommon.

Any suggestions are welcome, thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/o986zq/parking_recommendations_and_how_to_get_to_classes/,Zydico,1,2021-06-27 19:28:21,7,/r/WVU/comments/o986zq/parking_recommendations_and_how_to_get_to_classes/

I'm thinking of studying in the US next year, and I've heard good things about WVU (+ I have a few friends there). I was calculating the cost of attendance when I saw this:

""The Office of Admissions assigns every student enrolling at WVU a residency status for admission, tuition and fee purposes.""

This might be a stupid question, but what does that mean? Does it mean that everyone pays the in-state tuition (since there's an out-of-state tuition I presume that's not the case), or is it just something to make documentation easier?

I’m a 2nd semester junior this upcoming semester, I’ll be working a good bit (I work at Applebee’s) throughout the year so I won’t always be home.

You gotta clean up after yourself, contribute to food, and pay your rent. My last roommate has ended up not paying his rent since February and I’ve had to apply for gov. Assistance on his behalf to make *our* (even though it’s his) debt square. 

That being said, I think that same assistance will be paying 3 months forward on rent. So, whoever ends up signing with me will be ahead by 3 months and won’t have to pay a thing for a bit. I’m not exactly sure if that’ll be the case, but it definitely could be. 

The place is fully furnished but you will need to get your own stuff for your room. I’m not entirely sure what my current roommate plans on leaving here but it would be a safe bet to make sure you get your own stuff.

I’m open to both male and female roommates, so long as you don’t make it weird. I’m also trying to meet new people, I can be kind of awkward at times but I’m working on it!

Score! Only problem? The class is MW from 7-815 pm!! On Wednesday there is nearly a nine hour span between my second and third class of the day with this on my schedule. On Monday it's three hours. I really don't want this time.

POLS 103, or Global Poltial Issues, is taught in Woodburn Hall by David Hauser. It's TTH, and works perfectly into my schedule. The problem is the professor has more... mixed reviews on the website. Some say he gives out a ton of work, but overall he still gets high praise.

I've got a few questions if you guys would be so awesome to anwser...

1. StubHub or Scalp before the game? Right now on StubHub they have some upper deck seats for high $60s (I don't need fancy seats, they're playing Long Island...i'm more there for the atmosphere.) 
2. Are there any specific tailgating spots I should visit? Even if they're a bar. I prefer to be around the local yocals. 
3. Is it necessary to stay the night in Morgantown? The game is at 5pm so I was thinking I could save some dough and stay at a nearby town motel. Is there something I absolutely will miss out on if I don't stay in Morgantown?
4. How's your golf courses? I would love to golf one of your picturesque courses over by you. Is there a favorite that you guys like? I'm more of the view than the quality of the course. Prefer to stick around $50 for 18 if possible.

Atmosphere — On a white-out day for the Terrapins at Maryland Stadium, hundreds of Mountaineer supporters took advantage of a rare, drivable away game from the Mountain State. With the exception of a few neutral-site games in recent years – Tennessee at Charlotte in 2018, Virginia Tech at Landover in 2017, and BYU at Landover in 2016 – WVU's last regular-season road game was at Maryland in 2014. On a beautiful, bright Saturday afternoon, the Pride of West Virginia was also in attendance. Even though the stadium was not quite full (official attendance was 43,811), the matchup between the two long-time rivals provided a pleasant college football atmosphere.

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/WVU) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking.

Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add.

Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.

Hello everyone!

My name is Damian, and I'm an aerospace engineering student at UC Irvine. I've created a club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We talk about flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We also have plans to start doing projects as our org gets more established.

This post is being made on behalf of our WVU chapter, which is in the process of forming. We have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! If you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!

I am looking for possible housing options for next year. I will be a senior next year and would rather live alone for my last semester in Morgantown. Since I don't bring a car to campus, I am preferring to have a place that is within walking distance to campus (like to Towers or somewhere similar) since I have been walking for most of my academic career here. Also looking for a place that has laundry in the unit if possible. Price point not beyond $1100/mo for rent if possible.

I have been looking at different places on Evansdale (UPark, Harding Place, Aerostar, maybe State if I need to go towards that area but hopefully not) and I'd like to have any advice or input that I haven't covered yet. Please let me know any ideas so that I can sign a lease a bit on the early side and not have to worry about it for the rest of the semester!

For anyone who did something similar, or if you know of someone doing a similar major, what is it like? I live in Garrett County and the idea of not having your own vehicle is something very foreign to me. My parents say that there will be zero free time to do anything, which was probably an exaggeration, but hell I have no clue if its true or not. How is life not using a car to get place to place?

I know you can appeal citations but what genuine reason can I write down to get out of it?? This is what it states on the WVU website:

*”The following are not grounds for appeal:

1. lack of available parking,
2. unfamiliarity with University parking rules and regulations,
3. short time in violation area,
4. failure to observe posted signs,
5. class/instruction ran late,
6. anyone other than Parking Services or contracted parking lot attendants directed you to park in violation area,

t3xz68,Why’d you choose WVU? Looking to transfer,"Hello. So I’m a potential transfer student and I’m curious to ask current students why they chose to go to WVU and if y’all are happy with your decision.

A bit about me I guess. I’m two years into a BS Math at Ohio State but I’m not particularly happy there. And as an Ohio resident I get in state tuition for WVU so it’s one of the more logical choices 

The main thing I don’t like about OSU is the urban environment. Columbus is a depressing place to be. Huge urban sprawl and cornfields beyond that.

My hobbies are mainly outdoor things like trail running, hiking, mountain biking, camping, etc. Columbus is one of the worst cities when it comes to easy access to forests to do those things in. 

On the other hand, it seems Morgantown is very close to some awesome looking outdoor recreation. I’m wondering if there a large culture of students who are into those same activities I listed? 

On the academic side I’m interested in applied math, particularly neuroscience. I see that y’all have a pretty large neuroscience research center. Does anyone have experience there? I’d like to get involved in undergrad research. OSU had a pretty strong culture of undergrad research, does WVU have the same?

Anything else that made you personally choose WVU I’d love to hear as well

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/t3xz68/whyd_you_choose_wvu_looking_to_transfer/,iammeandthatsthat,1,2022-02-28 22:22:00,26,/r/WVU/comments/t3xz68/whyd_you_choose_wvu_looking_to_transfer/
t4gv6l,Questions about Software Engineering for game design (online master's),"Hi, 

I'm a prospective student wondering about what the game design/ACM was like at WVU for online students.

On top of that, was wondering about the online MSSWE classes in terms of rigor. How are CS classes like as well? Like, if I wanted to take artificial intelligence or any other conceptual courses in my master's for example.

I was really intrigued by the school since it just recently started offering an online MA in game design, but I work as a software engineer and have no plans to get off that horse. 

But yeah, any and all info. 

A little background from me since I was asking about the game design masters in conjunction to the software engineering masters, I graduated in 2016 with an IT degree from NJIT specializing in game dev. The school offered a lot at the time (and now, if you look at what they're doing with VR and AI with the biomedical engineering program) for combining software engineering principles in our game projects. I've done 10 global game jams with some game shown off at the end for 8 of them, I tried my hand at releasing a couple games on Google Play (free games) and GameJolt, and did some HTML game engines for HackNJIT 2015 and for an independent study class.

Basically wanted to take a master's part time to develop my network and to work on any gaps I'm missing from my current job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/t4gv6l/questions_about_software_engineering_for_game/,ff17cloud,1,2022-03-01 15:02:43,6,/r/WVU/comments/t4gv6l/questions_about_software_engineering_for_game/

t54v3c,Is WVU worth the absurd amount they are asking for?,"For Context on everything, WVU is a school that i’ve fallen in love with over recent years and became my dream school. Due to this, I applied and I got accepted; but a few problems occurred. The cost of going there is insane, 28k tuition + estimates of other essentials makes it around the 39-44k mark. Obviously this a lot of money. I was not eligible for any type of financial aid due to grades that weren’t the best and my parents making too much. I would like to send an appeal on this matter because I really think I deserve just a little bit of financial aid for a middle classed student.

Now there’s a twist to this, I run a very successful business for my age, pulling in an average from anywhere of 8-12k. Only recently have I seen this spike of money coming in (Start of the year) so it’s not like I have much capital. Anyway, by time college starts and with how i’ve built my business I should be able to make 10-15k a month. As I know I make good money, I still would like to pay as little as I can for my dream school. Is WVU worth the amount they’re asking for? I know i’ll only have this college experience once in my life and I know i can build up other businesses down the line of my life.

ublseb,DP Don't,"Help your local community, boycott DP Dough. About a month ago, DP Dough underwent new ownership. These owners brought their own relatives in to manage the place. Right off the bat, they fired 3 staff members and most of the original staff quit. Attached to this post is just a picture of how high the turnover rate has been here since they took over. Here are some of the reasons that we quit, and why you should boycott DP Dough until change happens.  


1- They cut employee-wide hours, citing labor was too high, but gave their selected managers (relatives) more hours despite claiming prior employee performance was great. None of the managers are qualified to handle food in the state of West Virginia.  
2- Every single person in upper management is now related in some way. The new co-managers and the owners are both together and have a child. They bring their children, the managers have even brought their baby (stroller and all), into the kitchen on the clock. All of them came from a store in Syracuse that has a rating of under 3 stars on Google. They are trying to run things the exact same way in Morgantown. The nepotism made the work environment extremely difficult to function in.  
3- The store is disgusting. When they took over, they claimed that they would be making changes for the benefit of the store. They've spent more time rearranging the store (and staff) than doing anything worthwhile. I personally witnessed both managers do dishes in the dishpit that was beyond infested with ants for multiple days, without doing anything about it. If you're eating food there, just know that multiple ants have touched the dishes your food was prepped on. I've also seen them store the cutting boards that we make calzones on by leaving them near the employee bathroom that was out of order for multiple months due to a black mold problem.  
4- They have entirely relied on other staff members to kill themselves working in order to give themselves an easier shift. They've given staff members multiple PAGES of to do lists in addition to making orders. The workload has tripled since they've come on to the point where staff has been reduced to tears due to the stress.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/ublseb/dp_dont/,gamerdudex145,1,2022-04-25 09:58:41,0,/r/WVU/comments/ublseb/dp_dont/

About the house: not furnished 3 bed, 1 bath, utilities included, $1500/month (Split 3ways it's only $500 each)

About me: I'm 21, about to start grad school for an English MA, and I get along with usually everybody.  I don't mind splitting the house with undergrads or grad students; I imagine I'd get along with either, and I'm not going to feel out of place, we're all just going to school lol. I'm pretty clean and pick up after myself. I don't make too much noise, and I don't need to party, although I'm not opposed to having fun once in a while if people feel up to it. I like to read, crochet, travel, swim, hike, and find new music. I love movies and can have a conversation on almost anything without getting bored.

vifpfn,Tips for making friends over the summer?," I am a rising senior and am wondering if anyone has any tips for making friends over the summer. I attended WVU my freshman year, ended up having to attend a college in my home state for sophomore year, and transferred back this past year as a junior. A lot of the friends I made as a freshman no longer attend WVU, and unfortunately the rest of them I really failed to keep in touch with. I got off on the wrong foot with my roommate this year so she and I are pretty distant, and I had a pretty intense class schedule, a lot of which were online, so it was really difficult to meet people or make any friends. I also dropped the ball on trying activities and clubs, which I know would have helped me out. Right now I’m taking my last round of online summer classes to get me up to speed in my major, and I really want to get out there and meet some new people. As a freshman  there were always things to do and people to hang out with, and I’m kind of at a loss over what to do because I haven’t had this problem before. I miss the nightlife in Morgantown, but more than that I miss the people, and I don’t know whether quarantine screwed with my head or what exactly changed , but it feels like it's getting harder for me to put myself out there. I’d like to try to meet new people over the summer, and since there are a lot less students around right now I was wondering if anyone has  any tips for that.

I am the proud owner of a fish and a few female mice. I may be adopting a few male rats in the near future as well. All rodents are kept in my bedroom and the aquarium is in the common area. I live in a 3BR and all of my roommates are totally fine with my animals. They are extremely clean, no smell, I take very good care of them.
I live in Upark, and while the pet policy on the website stipulates that only fish are allowed, I have not experienced any sort of enforcement of this rule. I don’t want my pets to be regimes or confiscated, and I was just wondering if anyone else has experience with keeping pets that weren’t cats or dogs in university apartments? When I was moving in I saw another girl moving a lizard and terrarium in. 

What is the worst that could happen if I get caught? Is it a slap on the wrist because they’re not cats/dogs or will I get into serious trouble?

My apartment is in Star City, so luckily I’m close to the coliseum and evansdale, to the point I may be able to bike or walk there, but driving would be ideal. Could anyone give me a good idea of how packed the pay-to-park lots will be on campus or around it in the first few weeks and hours of classes?

Remember those Moms, Dads, Grandparents, Guardians... they would love to hear your voice, be there for you with their unconditional love, just like when you were a small child. You ARE loved no matter what. Over the past couple of years you have slowly pulled away. Your friends have a larger share of your life than your family now, how it should be. It was hard for them to let go, but they are always thinking of you. Somtimes you get annoyed when they ask you lots of questions, but that’s just because they still long for a connection and are interested in everything you do.

As a result I'm being required to meet with my professor or a tutor in a separate sign up every week.

Is there anything I can do about this? Even with a separate sign up I am concerned. I have lectures starting at 11:30 and generally lasting until 1 or 1:20 every day, and on top of that on some days I have labs scheduled so I'm not actually out of classes and labs until 5:30.

xhoxwj,Having a very poor semester after transferring in. What’s the deadline to withdraw from classes?,"Hey guys, I’m not sure if this is the best place to ask but I am currently a transfer student from another university. I’ve had a rough semester here so far and I think I’m currently failing/behind in all my classes.

Previously, I was a junior in biology with around 60 hours/3.8GPA and have just switched majors to engineering. While all my credits transferred, the switch has practically made me a freshman again with 4 years to graduate.

Before the switch, I felt driven to do good with my classes and  coursework but now it just feels like my spark has gone out when it comes to studying and getting assignments done. 

Right now, it’s not that my classes are super difficult per se but my drive to get things done is nonexistent and with exams this week, I have let myself get hopelessly behind and have set myself for failure.

While I was attending my other school, I also had a good group of friends but since the transfer, I don’t know anyone and feel pretty alone. I try to be outgoing and have people I talk to regularly in specific classes but it seems that's as far as it goes and everyone has their friend groups established already.

What I was wondering was if any of you went through something similar and any advice you may have to give.

xl39t7,West Virginia is returning $86 million meant to help renters and landlords to the federal government,"Hey guys! 

I'm here this morning to share some investigative journalism I wrote for Mountain State Spotlight:

When the Mountaineer Rental Assistance Program stopped taking applications, some of our readers had questions. Where did all the money go?

A large amount didn’t reach West Virginians.

State officials estimate by mid-October, they’ll have returned $86 million of the program's original $350 million worth of funding to the feds. West Virginia spent this funding too slowly, so some was redistributed to other states. But this slow spending doesn't reflect a lack of need.

xm7nyd,Update on vasectomy through WVU Health with grad student insurance,"I posted a while ago asking about getting a vasectomy on the graduate student insurance, and I ended up going through with it. For anyone who's been considering it since Roe v. Wade was overturned, here's how it went.

TL;DR: Easy-peasy, bill should be between $370-700.

I started by getting a referral--just went to Student Health, had a quick conversation about it, and walked out with a referral to Dr. Henry Fooks at WVU Urology. I went in for the consult prepared to have to argue about it since I'm 27, single, and don't have kids already, but he just asked if I was aware it's considered a permanent procedure, and I told him I understood, and he went ahead and scheduled the surgery. Requests for vasectomies have skyrocketed, even here, since the SCOTUS decision, so I think these kinds of surgeries are probably going to be more accessible now than they were before. This may even be the case for the uterus-havers among you who are more likely to be refused permanent birth control because you might regret it or your future husband might be upset or some bullshit like that.

Went in for the surgery in late August. Was done under twilight anesthesia, not local, so I had a friend pick me up at the hospital. Of the maybe 6 or 7 nurses I talked to before the surgery, only one felt the need to grill me about the decision, as though I might call it off as they were wheeling me into the OR. All of the other nurses who happened to be around backed me up, so shoutout to y'all for that.

Recovery has been super smooth, but I'll spare y'all the graphic details here. PM me or comment if you want to know more about that.

I've been monitoring the claims associated with the surgery on Aetna's website, and they've all been processed except for one. The amount I had to pay on the main bill was $374.34, and there's one claim for about $330 still pending, so that cost might go up if they dump that one on me.

All things considered, it ended up being a lot cheaper than I thought it would be. 10/10, would recommend. Fuck SCOTUS, fuck Clarence Thomas in particular, and deez nuts shall never be an instrument of oppression.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/xm7nyd/update_on_vasectomy_through_wvu_health_with_grad/,PraiseTheButthole,1,2022-09-23 16:02:39,0,/r/WVU/comments/xm7nyd/update_on_vasectomy_through_wvu_health_with_grad/

My friends and I decided to try Vanessa's Kitchen at Seneca Center today cause it has such stellar reviews. But we left wondering if the reviews were faked or padded - it was basically a locked 5.0/5 stars, but the experience was really rough.

There was nobody to greet us in the entryway, leaving us wandering around. Gnats flying all over the place the whole time we were there, half of the items we wanted to order they were “out of”, including some of the most common items like the bread and steak fries. Ultimately, the food was “just okay”, especially considering the price. Definitely don’t see the hype.

After my friend posted a ""not recommended"" review on Facebook, the owner commented saying that leaving this honest review is “pretty shitty” and that we “need help”. She thinks we should have let her give us free food in exchange for a better review.

My sister passed away last week and I am definitely not going to be able to finish this semester as I have to take care of her affairs on top of grieving and I’m taking a tough course load. I think this qualifies as some type of emergency leave since the semester has already started, but I’m unsure. I printed out the leave of absence form but I feel like that’s only for people who are planning to miss a semester that hasn’t already started. The form also feels inconvenient because I really don’t want to meet in person with my advisor to have her sign it and all of that stuff. I would prefer to just get this taken care of as soon as possible. I’m a little worried that it won’t be accepted or something too.

y40fw8,Mountain State Spotlight's guide to voting in West Virginia,"Hi all,

I just wanted to shared that my newsroom, Mountain State Spotlight, recently launched a comprehensive [guide](https://mountainstatespotlight.org/2022-west-virginia-voter-guide/#polling-place) to voting in West Virginia. You can learn about the proposed amendments to the state constitution, various important deadlines, and the candidates running in your district. 

If you're not sure what district you're in, we have a [tool](https://mountainstatespotlight.org/2022/10/07/the-wv-races-where-abortion-is-on-the-ballot/) that lets you look that up with your address. It'll tell you which candidates you can vote for. 

Finally, we have a few stories about topics related to the election. I wrote a story this summer about Amendment 2, the Property Tax Modernization Amendment. Framed as a way to pass helpful tax cuts on the workingman's personal car, if voters approve this amendment, it could lead to massive holes in local budgets. The Legislature currently has no concrete plan for replacing those lost funds. 

And my coworker, Ian Karbal, also wrote a story explaining where ""abortion is on the ballot"" in West Virginia. Which districts have both pro-abortion rights and anti-abortion rights candidates running? Find out [here](https://mountainstatespotlight.org/2022/10/07/the-wv-races-where-abortion-is-on-the-ballot/).
