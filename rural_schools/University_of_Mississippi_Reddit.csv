blohmq,Best Southern City for a Mid 20's Guy?,"Im a mid 20s single guy and am looking to a city in the South. A little bit about me, I was born in Santa Monica and have lived in Orange County, CA since college. I love football and a sports culture in general. I have always wanted to experience living in another state and environment for at least 6 months or so before I get to old and the opportunity passes. My plan is to end up coming back to California after that but I wouldn't be opposed to staying long term if I enjoy it.

I am having trouble picking a city to move to. To put what I like into perspective, I grew up in LA and pretty much hated it. The traffic, sprawling city, run down places, people generally rude, no culture at all, expensive etc. I enjoy Orange county a lot better but still doesn't have much a culture (food, sports, or other) except for maybe a beachy vibe near the coast. Also which I feel is similar, I enjoyed Fort Worth more than Dallas when i visited because it felt less like a ""big city"" which I have always lived in. Regarding cost, remember I live in Southern California and am paying $1,000 to have my own room but share a bathroom in an apartment so it cant get much worse than out here. The cheapest 1 bedrooms are $1600 minimum here.

The reason for the south is that I love everything about it even though I have only been to Texas. I love country music, college football, sports in general, bbq food, live music, and am a conservative. And the southern accent is so amazing to me. The city doesn't have to be conservative obviously but being in a red state is appealing to me in general. I do like the outdoors and camping and am not crazy about the beach since I grew up with it (except for its amazing weather). Im basically looking for something different then what i grew up with. I like going out to bars/clubs sometimes but I mainly like not as crazy bars and love live music type atmospheres and two stepping bars. I like the South/East Coast area because it would give me the chance to travel to a lot of sports cities on weekends and see some NFL, MLB, and college football stadiums I wouldn't have the chance to see. I have traveled to a lot of cities across the US. Denver, Austin, Philly, Chicago, New York, San Fran, Boston, etc and found that a lot of big cities can sort of blend together in how they feel.

So basically for at least 6 months im looking for something different. My first thought was Nashville obviously because of the country music and live music scene. But after looking at videos and talking to friends, it mainly seems like a Southern version of vegas which seems miserable with traffic, tourists, non stop partying etc. And just in general not that different because of the tourists.

The 3 most recommended cities ive seen are Chattanooga, Greenville, and Huntsville. Also: Auburn, Athens, Jackson, Oxford, Charleston, Savannah, Birmingham, Louisville, Kansas City, Asheville, Biloxi, and Richmond. Not sure if I missed any. I wouldnt want Texas because ive been there so many times even though I do love it. And definitely not Atlanta because that seems like exactly what I wouldnt like.

For work I am currently a Front Desk agent at a hotel for a Hilton, so that gives me an opportunity to potentially transfer to one of these cities. Beyond that if I cant transfer, it would be nice if the job market in the city is relatively good (or if im able to drive for uber and lyft and make a decent amount in the mean time). Also of course the city with the hottest girls gets +10 points haha",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/blohmq/best_southern_city_for_a_mid_20s_guy/,moneyyman,6,2019-05-07 05:15:18,20,/r/olemiss/comments/blohmq/best_southern_city_for_a_mid_20s_guy/

Just wondering if there is any sort of social soccer competition held in the Fall Semester?

bsiufw,Best SEC games to go to?,"Hey guys, 27m here huge sports fan in Southern California. The sports culture, especially college out here is garbage. I grew up going to all the USC/UCLA (Go Bruins) games but those werent always the best atmospheres. Ive always wanted to live in the south (for a few reasons including college football) for half a year or so and am moving there (either Nashville, Greenville SC, or Birmingham. still deciding where) this August until new years or so.

My plan is to go to the absolute BEST college football games this year every Saturday or so in the south. I will be driving. And it doesnt matter if I have to leave at midnight Friday and come back Sunday. My main sport is NFL (Go Broncos) and I havent followed college football at an intricate level so I want to know not only the best teams to to see live (obviously Bama, Clemson, UGA etc), but the best teams to see them play against. Im sure the atmospheres are completely different bases on if they are die hard rivals or not. Like when I see the Broncos play in Denver the games vs the Chiefs, Raiders, and Pats have such a better atmosphere than playing teams like the bengals, redskins, or rams.

So far I know that seeing the Iron bowl would be a must do (even though tickets are around $300 right now), and LSU at night (also how do you know which games are night games since the times aren't out yet)? Of course seeing UGA is big but what opponent games that they would play would have the best atmosphere? Some people mentioned seeing the Sandman atmosphere at VT too.

Some of the options ive read: Bama, clemson, auburn, tennessee, LSU, Gainsville, UGA, South Carolina, VT, Florida State, Ole Miss, Memphis, A&amp;m (but this is probably out because a bit too far to drive to for the weekend), Arkansas, Arkansas State, Miss state. Any more?

So far ive narrowed down some ones that could be good by date. Im not worried about skipping some weeks or going to just ""average games"" for the sake of my time or wallet.

Here is the 2019 schedule for reference

[http://www.espn.com/college-football/schedule](http://www.espn.com/college-football/schedule)

8/31: Not any huge games it looks like but do any openers have great atmospheres? Someone mentioned **Ole Miss at Memphis** will be a wild one. That Thursday is a night game **GT at Clemson**. Not sure how that will be.

9/7: **A&amp;M at Clemson?** Seems to be the best Clemson game all year.

9/14: **Bama at South Carolina?**

9/21: Coincidentally im probably going to the **Michigan at Wisconsin** game this weekend since ill be in Green Bay for the Broncos Packers game. and yes I know UGA is hosting Notre Dame but cant go to that

9/28: Not sure, any good ones? **Towson Tigers at Florida?** lol jk **Ole Miss at Bama?** Would probably be going to a bigger bama game later in the year but would go twice if its worth it. Someone mentioned **Cincinnati at Marshall and also maybe Clemson at UNC.**

10/5: **Auburn at Florida** at the swamp is a game everyone is recommending. But this could be my only good chance to see the Vols when its **UGA at Tenn.** So not sure.

10/12: Wedding this weekend no games. I know, California.

10/19: I heard about the 3rd Saturday of October when its **Vols at Bama.** But would probably be going to the better LSU at Bama later in the year so not sure if I should go twice. If I dont go it could be a good chance to go to the Grove. **A&amp;M at Ole Miss? LSU at Miss State?** Not sure which one of those would be better.

10/26: **Auburn at LSU** seems to be a lock. Want it to be a night game. Plus Saints play on that sunday.

\---10/31 Someone mentioned if I can go halloween night **GT at App State** would be fun.

11/2: **UGA at Florida?** The cocktail party seems like a blast even though im already going to a game in florida. I know this game is at a nuetral stadium. Someone also mentioned **Miami at Florida State?**

11/9: **LSU at Bama?** Seems like an good one.

11/16: **UGA at Auburn?** I heard that this game is not to be missed. But would already be going to the Auburn game vs Bama 2 weeks later. And if I dont do this one, I would be able to see **LSU at Ole miss** if that is a good one.

11/23: **A&amp;M at UGA?** Plus Falcons play on that sunday.

11/30: **Bama at Auburn?** The Iron bowl.

Im not sure if all this would be realistic but I want to see as many good games as I can.

Also Ill be probably going alone to these games. Any recs on how to kind of blend in/make friends via tailgating when at the game? Any best tailgate spots places to go?

My location in the south would be central so these should be a 8ish hour drive or closer. Also any recommendations on best cities to live in the south? Don't want something too touristy (still want that southern feel) but dont want a pure college atmosphere so that ill stand out if not going to the school. Thanks guys. Also 2 games in one day or weekend is possible im sure but would probably need to wait for the time of the games to be announced.

Are night games much better atmospheres in the same way NFL night games are much better than the day games?",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/bsiufw/best_sec_games_to_go_to/,moneyyman,7,2019-05-24 12:16:16,14,/r/olemiss/comments/bsiufw/best_sec_games_to_go_to/

cj6oqr,Visiting Ole Miss for an OOC game in Sept - few questions regarding what to expect,"I'm coming down with a friend of mine for the Cal @ Ole Miss game in September. This will be my first time in Mississippi, first time at an SEC game and only really my third time in the South (if you count Austin or Orlando/Miami as the south....).

So I got a few questions, about how things work, etiquette, etc.

* Do you guys sell out all games? Will this be a sellout? My understanding is that the SEC doesn't care about the Pac-12 unless it's a ""sexy"" team like SC or Oregon (/roll eyes).

* I really want to check out the Grove, but I'm curious of etiquette. I've heard for Ole Miss fans there's usually a dress code (well I guess it's a southern thing). I usually just wear a gameday tshirt ([example](https://calstudentstore.berkeley.edu/products/university-of-california-berkeley-under-armour-legacy-triblend-tee-unde-9707-pxtognlguy)), jeans and maybe a jersey (probably a Rodgers one). Will I get nasty comments (outside of the usual visiting team ribbing that I'd expect)?

* We're not expecting to get invited to any tailgates, but what is the etiquette if we do? Just join in and have fun? Or are people expected to bring booze or something? 

* Speaking of which, can we carry around a beer while wandering the Grove?

* How safe or unsafe is driving down from Memphis at like 11PM? 

* Given the recent Emmett Till incident with the frat boys, I have to ask. I'm Indian (and pretty dark skinned) and my buddy is Japanese. Neither of us have an accent we're either been living in the country for most of our lives (legally) or were born here. What sort of racial experiences are we in for? My friend is actually been hesitating to come but we already paid so much...

d5hudi,Cal fan headed to Oxford -- ticket recs sought,"Hello, Ole Miss! My girlfriend, three friends and I are really excited to attend the game this weekend and experience The Grove!

It looks like sight lines are pretty good from all seats, but I wanted to gauge any spots to potentially avoid for a group of five. I personally like sitting somewhat high in the end zone to see plays develop, but I am with four other people and would like them to be as happy as possible (and obviously sitting low in the end zone cuts off too much of the field). Thus, my general questions are this:

\-- Are there any general areas of the stadium to AVOID? (i.e. sun too heavy, too close to sideline meaning players get in the way of good views). Do you suggest sections or **rows that you should not go below** to assure a clear view of the game? The idea, obviously, is that while it may feel cool to be in Row 1, I've found that leads to staring into the backs of the redshirting freshmen and making it extremely difficult to see the game.

\-- While I love my fellow Cal fans ... I don't necessarily want to sit with them and am not really keen on sitting in the visitor section. The fun of attending a college football game as a visitor is to chop it up with opposing fans, especially at a place so unique as The Grove. Plus, let's be honest here, talking football with many Cal fans often feels like trying to teach your dog the English language. I'd much rather shoot the shit with SEC fans. With that said, I don't want to find myself trapped in the student section. I'm guessing I can find good sections that are generally populated by Ole Miss fans outside of the North End Zone, where the student section appears to be.

\-- Since we have five people together and the stadium appears to be mostly benches, would it be wisest to buy five seats across or three seats in one row and two seats directly below us in another?

If you have any other essential recommendations for our time there, we'd love to hear them! Obviously we'll be up bright and early with the morning kickoff and I've been looking forward to this game for years. We want to maximize this experience as much as possible. This is a long checklist, so feel free to answer any (not necessarily all) questions. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/d5hudi/cal_fan_headed_to_oxford_ticket_recs_sought/,gb914,4,2019-09-17 10:33:39,13,/r/olemiss/comments/d5hudi/cal_fan_headed_to_oxford_ticket_recs_sought/

dc3vbs,"""Technology"" requirement for freshman admission?","Hello everyone, I've finished my application for Ole Miss but I'm hesitant to submit it due to the 1/2 ""Technology"" unit requirement. I'm worried that my California high school doesn't offer any classes that satisfy this, and that my transcript therefore doesn't satisfy this requirement. The only class that I think could maybe work here is AP Computer Science Principles, which I'm taking this year. Does anyone know more about this requirement for admission, and how it works? Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

We elected a Mr. Ole Miss is on the spectrum, reflecting a strong support for a student from an under appreciated group on campus.

On the athletics side: Coach Yo picked up a 5* recruit, who is also the highest rated recruit in women’s basketball history. Coach Kermit Davis and our students helped raise over $10,000 for the American Cancer society this week, and our basketball team is poised to have a strong year this year. Our volleyball team beat State tonight and is on a 10 game win streak and is on fire in conference play. 

We are ranked within the top 100 public schools in the nation and the best in the state. Our online MBA program is ranked in the top ten in the nation, and our education program is ranked in the top 35. Last year, our university produced a Rhodes Scholar and a Fulbright Scholar, which are both amazing in their own rights.

We have a lot going for us at our university and within our student body in spite of what has transpired this week by our state’s IHL.

I’m a reporter at Business Insider and I’m reaching out because I’m working on a project right now that I thought could be of interest to y’all. We are reaching out to students all around the world to see what a day in the life is like for students at different schools. This week, we’re focusing on the University of Mississippi. 

The project would involve **taking 15 to 20 photos of your life at Ole Miss** and submitting them, along with brief descriptions

Are you a student doing something unusual that you think more people should know about? Do you know of any hidden gems or strange places on campus that deserve more attention? Do you often find yourself caught in funny or unexpected situations? Do you know of any scandals or bad behavior on campus? Are you a regular at some of the school's wildest parties? Are you an elite athlete? If you can answer yes to any of these, we’d love to hear from you.

Please reach out if you have a compelling story idea about college that you think could be told through a photo series. We are **offering $160 to anyone we decide to publish** and we are open to keeping these anonymous if necessary. Hope to hear from y’all. Thanks!

e4zzaa,An open letter to my Ole Miss family,"Good morning,

Some of you may remember me from the last time I appealed to you all regarding our mascot selection. Most of you ignored the overarching points I raised at that time concerning Admiral Akbar being the greatest and most obvious choice:

1: He was the greatest rebel leader in the galaxy (Admiral outranks Colonel)

2: The entire stadium could yell “It’s a trap!” every time the defense reads blitz

3: He’s a freaking anthropomorphized Mississippi catfish for God sake!

But I digress as I’m not here today to remind us of the shortcomings of our past choices but to talk about the way forward. We’re on the eve of announcing a multi-million-dollar nation wide search to find the best coach for our great university. At this point I’d like you all to consider a candidate as we move through this process, despite him likely not being on the search committee to suggest himself as he’s totally allowed to do cause reasons. 

But first I’d like to take a moment to speak to our outgoing coach, Matt Luke.

Matt. Undoubtedly no one loves Ole Miss as much as you. I think I speak for most of the Alumni and fans when I say you are a great person and despite your shortcomings in your position as head coach we love you and wish you the best. The silver lining in all this that I hope you see is, based on the history of Ole Miss head coaches removed for on field performance reasons, you have a bright future. Why in a decade or so you too might be loved by the nation for unseating a dynasty team bound for another CFP, having a lovable cheeky accent, and your outstanding H3 Hummer commercials.

To the Alumni, students, family, friends and fans of Ole Miss I think our course forward is clear. There is only one choice that suits us, and I think in your heart of hearts you all know it is obvious. We must hire Lane Kiffin to lead Ole Miss football into the next decade and beyond. 

There are three major points that I will outline for those of you on the fence about this choice:

1: Meme Magic – It’s difficult to deny in this day in age the power of the internet and memes in making something good great or tearing down something bad. Meme magic is real and we must recognize the power that Kiffin holds in this area. From the moment Lane was left standing slack jawed on that runway in Arizona he began to embrace this power. Today he wields incredible strength from twitter some could say even rivals the president. The glass ceiling is broken and if memes can propel someone into the highest office in the land (love him or hate him) memes can make Ole Miss football great again.   

2: Instant national recognition from non-sports fans – With the short memories of many Americans I think many of you may have forgotten that Kiffin was a regularly featured centerpiece of a major cable network show even as an assistant coach. If you don’t remember Daniel Tosh’s Kiffin’s Krimson Korner then you should take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with what lane can bring us in terms of recognition from fans of terrible comedy and not just football fans. 

3: Cost effectiveness – I feel like many don’t recognize the opportunity we have in this area specifically as much as they should. We all know head coaches are expensive. At Ole Miss this means $3-4M base plus potential bonuses for performance. We often forget though that we have things to offer in terms of a total package that other universities do not. Chatsports.com recently ranked Ole Miss female fan base as the hottest in the SEC and we all know that with Lane Kiffin comes Joey Freshwater.  By conducting his interview near the women’s athletics practice facilities, we stand to save millions in contract negotiations with Kiffin. 

I know that many of you are looking at Kiffin’s history and thinking he’ll abandon us in a few short years but I think that Lane is just looking for a home where he and Joey can both be happy. I want to ask you all to consider giving Lane this home and birthing a legend on the Oxford square. For future generations the choice is clear. Make the right one Ole Miss.  Or don’t whatever I’m just an anonymous dude on the internet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/e4zzaa/an_open_letter_to_my_ole_miss_family/,Knowakennedy,1,2019-12-02 09:42:53,14,/r/olemiss/comments/e4zzaa/an_open_letter_to_my_ole_miss_family/

eisx1t,Why is college life not working for me?,"I’m posting here on a throwaway just on the off chance anyone on here could figure out who I am... I’m a freshman at Ole Miss. I’m majoring in IMC. In high school, I was in band, I was involved with my school’s news publication, I was on an academic team, and I had plenty of friends. I hung out with people every weekend. I was also captain/leader of most things I was in by my senior year. To put it pretty simply, life was great. And now not so much...

This year has really been tough. I was nervous about coming to college and having to make new friends, and when I got there on move in day, my fears were kind of put at ease because people talked to me and I got a little group. Things were okay, but then after a couple of months, typical teenager drama happened and the group stopped talking. Most people in the group hate each other now and I can’t talk to them. So now I’m alone. 

I didn’t join a frat because of several reasons.. mostly that I 1. don’t like partying and 2. didn’t have the money. So I don’t have that outlet to make friends. I got involved with one of the school’s news publications and wrote there this semester, but I didn’t really make any real friends doing it. I also wanted to join some clubs, but when I went through the list, the only ones that really seemed to be interesting were either sports (which I suck at and would not enjoy playing) or religion (which I don’t do) so, once again, not really helpful. 

I went to every football game this year. I’ve been to basketball games. I showed up to the journalism school’s “mingle” thing. I shared notes with someone from one of my classes when he needed them. I’m from Mississippi, so I have familiar faces on campus who are mostly people from my high school, but it’s just not clicking for me. I don’t have what I would consider actual friends. If I desperately wanted to, I could find people to go eat with or something, but not real friends.

I don’t know why it’s this hard... I try to put myself out there and go and participate in things, but I am pretty selective about the activities I’ll join and do because, to be honest, I suck at everything.

Last year we choke against 3-4 different football teams that could’ve given us a winning record, and we blow a something like 6 run lead against Vanderbilt in the SEC tournament.

g5f712,Is parking a problem at Ole Miss?,"Hello guys! Since the last year, I’ve been working on a project to address the parking problem at universities. I’ve developed a business model that provides a solution to the problems I identified at FAU, the university I went for my bachelors. Later, I realized from talking to students from other Universities, that the problems are present in most of the largest Universities in the USA. Bellow is what we heard the most from other students:

&gt;Every semester students face the same problem; having to arrive at school 45 minutes to one hour earlier just to be able to have time to find a parking spot. It is a real hassle being able to find a parking spot and it becomes frustrating and stressful. 

A group of friends and I decided to continue with the idea and er committed to solving the problem by designing a solution to help students and faculty to find parking much faster. So, to help us better build a solution for the students and the schools, we are asking students at various Universities a few questions about their experience when parking at your university campus. We would appreciate your help with this! We are on the way to developing something GREAT for the infrastructure, not only for one university but for all other universities in the United States.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.

It is a Google Forms format, and it will only take you **1 minute!**

**Thank you!**

gxnsq8,Ole Miss's Xenophobic Program,"The CISS ( Center for Intelligence and Security Studies) goes against the values of Ole Miss by limiting their program to only American citizens. With all the talk about fighting racism and bigotry by the Provost, I'm surprised that he hasn't made a statement about the program's institutionalized discrimination. 

[https://ciss.olemiss.edu/faq/](https://ciss.olemiss.edu/faq/)

&gt;Applicants also must be American citizens, given the program’s emphasis on placing students into sensitive internships and jobs that require a Secret or Top Secret security clearance.

Intelligence Analysts are hired by private sector firms in all sorts of industries, working for the CIA or any of the other government intelligence agencies is not the only career path. The program shouldn't be pushing students into working for the government over working for the private sector.  The Law School at Ole Miss doesn't push students to work for the government, and neither should any of the other programs. 

If Ole Miss really cares about fighting racism and discrimination they should open the program to students that aren't citizens.",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/gxnsq8/ole_misss_xenophobic_program/,ibmtactful,1,2020-06-06 05:23:01,12,/r/olemiss/comments/gxnsq8/ole_misss_xenophobic_program/

Groups complete verbal, written, and behavioral exercises together during the sessions. Participants learn about body activism, how to manage societal pressures to look a certain way, and discuss the costs of pursuing a beauty ideal. 

*Who is in the group with me?*

Each group consists of 6 women and 2 Peer Leaders. We randomly assign groups based on availability. 

*How much does it cost?*

ieam2a,Ole Miss tuition,"I see a lot of people complaining about the cost of tuition at Ole Miss, with a lot of people implying that the University is ripping people off, or out for money. This is pretty much the opposite of true.  Ole Miss is one of the cheapest public schools in the country.  Pretty much all of your tuition goes to paying for the salaries of the people that teach you, and there's not much left over.  This is true for both in state and out of state students. The only schools that are cheaper are in wealthy states with large tax bases where they heavily subsidize school costs.  


Even in the southeast, Ole Miss is cheap.  Compare with other major universities in the area:  


School                          In state                          Out of state   
Ole Miss                       8800                               25,000  
U of Alabama              11,580                            30,250  
U of Georgia                12,080                            31,120

LSU                                11,962                            28,639

UT Austin                      11,400                           41,000

U Tennessee                 13,264                            31,684  


Note: some schools have a different cost structure that includes tuition + mandatory fees.  In those cases I added the fees to the tuition.  These aren't things like parking and the other fees Ole Miss charges. They charge those fees, in addition to these other fees.  All calculations are based on 15 hours per semester.  


As you can see, Ole Miss is the cheapest of any of these by far.  Students at Ole Miss are getting a bargain, not being ripped off.  It may seem pricey, but this is just what it costs to hire qualified faculty to teach you professional skills, and have buildings and facilities to teach you in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/ieam2a/ole_miss_tuition/,Ok_Kaleidoscope_9378,1,2020-08-21 22:34:03,3,/r/olemiss/comments/ieam2a/ole_miss_tuition/

iy4l7a,Help High Schoolers Learn About Ole Miss!,"What’s up r/olemiss; your moderators have graciously granted me permission to tell you about the website that I intern for, so if you’re interested in helping prospective students learn about Ole Miss from a distance please stick around.

CollegeVizzy, the aforementioned website, was created several years ago by a moderator and active member of r/ApplyingToCollege who was determined to bridge the gap between colleges and applicants who wanted to visit, but lacked the ability (for whatever reason).  As you can probably imagine, the onset of the pandemic has created some new urgency to roll out a new-and-improved iteration of the platform.  

So what is CollegeVizzy? In a nutshell, it’s a place where college students can make prompted social-media style posts about their college campus—and where prospective students can compile and share notes and impressions of universities they’ve visited.  The end result, we hope, will be a resource that provides a somewhat more comprehensive look at a given college than a virtual tour or an Instagram page might otherwise by itself.  And right now, more than probably ever until this point, high school students could use as much information as possible to learn about the schools they’re considering.

To make this resource a reality, we need a strong content-creating user base.  And that’s where you guys can help.  If you’re interested in making an account and sharing ~stuff~ about Ole Miss, the link is below.  Everything is free, there are no ads, we sell no user data, and making a post will enter you into a giveaway that we’re running for a $150 Uber Eats gift card.     

Tell us anything!  Show us your favorite places on campus or the quietest study spots (actually probably not that); whatever you’d want prospective students to know about.  If you have any questions about the site or about posting, or any feedback, leave it down below.  I didn’t want to make this post unbearably long, so if there’s anything that doesn’t make sense or isn’t clear I would be more than happy to follow up in the comments!

And thank you if you made it this far; the SEC in particular has been very kind to us.  Much appreciated!

jb4ad7,Sorority rush,I am a senior in high school and from the north. I am strongly considering attending ole miss next year and joining a sorority. I am from the north where greek life isn’t as big so I don’t know anyone who could write me letters of recommendation. I also have a gpa on the lower end (2.3). I have always wanted to join a sorority but I know letters of recommendation and gpa are big factors. Should i still rush or do I not have a shot at getting a bid. Would I be better off waiting for spring rush. I was also wondering if there is still stuff do and have fun without joining greek life as it is such a big part of the school.

jbbs1c,Keep Mississippi Universities Open Facebook Group Founder is an Ole Miss Student,"I'm not sure if you guys have seen this, but there's a nasty Facebook group called ""Keep Mississippi Universities Open"" that is ""demanding"" that universities immediately open, and to hell with covid restrictions and the CDC.  Seems they feel that student social life is more important than community health, and they're encouraging their members to harass, bully, and threaten faculty members and administrators who don't agree with them, even posting childish insults directed towards specific faculty and personal contact info.

The founder of the group is some woman named Faith Gardener, from Birmingham, and it turns out that her daughter is Anna Frances Gardner, who is a business major here at Ole Miss. She's also a Delta Gamma sorority member, which figures, I reckon.

Whether you like online classes or not, hopefully you at least agree that the virus is dangerous to certain members of our community, and that as responsible citizens, we have to make some personal sacrifices to protect them. Everyone wants to go back to in person classes, but with the distancing requirements, it's still going to be necessary to limit class sizes, even if we have more contact than we did this semester.  Throwing our vulnerable community members to the wolves so you can tailgate in the grove is beyond irresponsible and bordering on criminal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/jbbs1c/keep_mississippi_universities_open_facebook_group/,Electronic-Account-3,1,2020-10-14 19:06:13,2,/r/olemiss/comments/jbbs1c/keep_mississippi_universities_open_facebook_group/

We are a team of undergraduate students, medical students, PhD students, medical doctors, and other professionals who are invested in improving the well-being of homeless communities around the world- including yours. H4H was originally founded by students at the University of Central Florida and has since grown into an international organization with over 15 chapters across the United States, Brazil, and India. With your passion, we aim to work with you to help you positively impact your homeless community. Together, we can better fulfill our goal of improving the condition of humanity! 

We are **interested in working with student leaders** who want to innovate, to serve, and to enact change. For student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time, leadership, and compassion. We will take care of the rest. The lives you will change, the friends you will make, and the experiences you will gain will be invaluable.

The work of our students has helped so many, and for this reason, it has been recognized by the US Congress, the Brazilian government, President Clinton, educational and medical institutions, and other non-profit institutions as well.

A month or so ago, she got an email saying students could try to appeal their contract for the spring, but if they did not get out of it, they'd have to pay a $2,700 (something like that) ""ghost housing"" fee, where they don't get a room but still get stuck with the housing fee. Or they could try to pay a little extra and get a spot on campus. She just checked her schedule for next semester and its looking like 3 online, 2 hybrid for classes. My question is to other students in the same situation, would you appeal and take your chances and if you don't get released, pay the ghost housing fee, OR would you just go ahead and pay for the room on campus, even if you didn't end up living there all the time?

k16yuc,Highland Square,"In the past two years Highland Square has dramatically gone to shit with street racing (that turn into police pursuits), burglaries, house raids, the worst maintenance and facilities I’ve ever seen (I’ve literally seen them drop a washer 6 times off a truck then still deliver it), gang activity, no WiFi half the time, and the CA’s always seem to make up an excuse for all of this. Doesn’t surprise me the property has been sold almost three times in the past two years.. 

I moved from Highland to the Retreat because of this but I just want to know why people haven’t been trying to change this or why people are still falling for Highlands marketing just to move in and fall victim to this place. I understand it’s a college residential property but there’s no way it can be this bad. People are calling this place dangerous for a reason. 

So to everybody about to sign a lease, PLEASE for the love of god see this warning and consider somewhere else.

Anyway- I'm excited to get involved on campus, mainly through a fraternity, but I have absolutely no idea about where to start with that (when the time comes).

So I have a few questions:

As an out of state student, will I automatically have a hard time getting into a good frat? I go to a private school so I've heard that I'm pretty much on the same page as Jackson Prep/somewhat-snotty Ole Miss crowd. I'm not really like that but I'm assuming that will help me? lol 

Also, when does the rushing process start? I heard it starts maybe a week before classes, so how would that work for an out of state student like me?

khba4a,"For those going through a tough time during COVID, I hope my Ole Miss story can help","This isn't an inquiry or advice seeking post but I thought I'd share my journey at Ole Miss because it was far from your typical 4-5 year conventional college experience. I hope this could maybe help or inspire some of you going through a tough time during this pandemic that you will make it through this:

&amp;#x200B;

I started at Ole Miss in 2012 majoring in accounting and minored finance with the full intention of finishing in the normal 4 year time span and moving on but of course, life had other plans. I started out rocky and failed a couple courses my freshman year and had 1.9 GPA after a full year. The next year my dad suffered a massive heart attack which he has thankfully recovered fully from, but this caused me to pause my education temporarily to move back home and help my mom care for my dad as he recovered.

By this time it was 2015 and I was 1.5 years behind where I was supposed to be. Between personal crises and my grades taking a hit, my mental health also did and I fell into depression. I had no desire to return to school and no idea what I wanted in life. Fast forward a few months, luckily I had a great support system, I got the help I needed, and re-enrolled in school in January 2017.

I doubled down and did nothing but focus on doing my best to finish school, meet as many people as I could, and finally move on. Aaaand then 2020 came and COVID hit me like a ton of bricks. Ten days in the hospital over the summer wondering if I was going to ever get out but I made a full recovery and finally finished up this journey last week. I managed to raise my GPA from 1.9 in my first year to a 3.6 and graduated with honors from the Patterson School!!

It’s called College Hush, where you as a college student are paid to speak with prospective students over Zoom and give them honest insight into your university experience. It’s a remote work opportunity, simple to get involved, low commitment, and easy way to make some extra money.

klz1ve,International applying to Ole Miss,"Hi guys!  
I'm an international who is considering attending in the fall! For context, I have close family members who are graduates of the University of Southern Mississippi so they've encouraged me to apply here.   
I can't say I know much about the institution which is why I'm reaching out!   
Currently, I have a 3.8 GPA and 1370 on the SAT. I'm not sure what my chances are of being admitted since I'm not familiar with the application process but if anyone could elaborate it would be welcome.  
I'd also like to inquire about what the environment on campus is like. A lot of people tell me that Mississippi is really hospitable and my family member from Southern Miss also mention that it was a welcoming environment. However, a lot of others have warned me to stay away, and its led to a confusing dilemma.   
I've also heard that the experience varies between towns. What is Oxford like? Are there a lot of fun things to do to keep you busy when you're not studying? Is it welcoming?  
Lastly, I would be applying as a business major. What is the business school at the institution like?  
Any info you could share about what college and city life is like would be very helpful!

As directed, we will continue to follow the MSDH criteria and phases, and hope to be able to open to additional phases soon.

At this time, this vaccination site is intended to serve only University of Mississippi employees. The vaccine will be administered free of charge.

**How do I schedule an appointment?**

To make an appointment to receive a vaccine inside the Tad Smith Coliseum, please visit the following link: [https://uofmississippi.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_4TTmYyDX79HCU61](https://uofmississippi.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4TTmYyDX79HCU61).

Second dose appointments will be scheduled in the appointment scheduler while you are making your first appointment. To make sure you receive the same type of vaccine, please schedule your second dose appointment at the same location where you received your first dose. 

**Where and when will vaccines be given?**

The vaccines will be available inside the Tad Smith Coliseum concourse. Appointments are available on the following days and times: 

Friday, March 12: 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m.

Tuesday, March 16: 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. 

Thursday, March 18: 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

**What if I have a history of anaphylaxis?**

**If you have a history of anaphylaxis\* and carry an EpiPen, you will need to receive your vaccine in a clinic setting such as Baptist Memorial Hospital. You can schedule an appointment with BHM by calling the following number:** 662-636-4353.

\*anaphylaxis – a severe allergic reaction that leads to wheezing, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, rash, swelling in the throat and lowered blood pressure that starts between five to 30 minutes after contact with an allergen.

**About the vaccine**

To be effective, **two** doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine are required. Both doses must be the same vaccine. The second Pfizer vaccine dose should be given within three to six weeks after your first dose.

**Logistics of Appointments**

* Vaccination will take place inside the Tad Smith Coliseum.
* Patients may park in the coliseum parking lot and enter the coliseum at their appointment time through the right main entrance around the concourse.
* Patients should arrive several minutes early.
* A parking pass and a few medical forms will be emailed to patients. **Patients should complete and bring this paperwork to the appointment**.
* Social-distancing and mask-wearing guidelines will be observed in the coliseum.
* Pharmacists and trained student pharmacists under the supervision of a clinical pharmacist will administer the vaccine, as well as be available to answer questions at the appointment.
* After patients have received their dose of the vaccine, they will be asked to remain in an observation area for 15 minutes for monitoring.
* You can still obtain vaccines through the [Mississippi drive-thru sites](https://covidvaccine.umc.edu/) if you prefer.

n082pv,Community Service Project,"After this semester I have a bunch of flex left. I wanted to use it for something good and purchase food to give away to the local homeless in/around downtown memphis. If anybody would be interested in contributing please PM me so we can connect ! 
Also, if anybody is really interested in community service or giving back but you don’t have any flex I wanted to raise money for homeless individuals to visit the shelter. I thought it was kinda shitty that they charged them $7.50 to enter the shelter. So along with the food I wanted to give them an envelope with some money to get into the shelter for the night (or longer depending on how many donations I receive) funds can be given through cashapp or in person if in the oxford/ north MS area.

It seems like a program to help make the transition from high school to college easier but why is there a $440 fee? Is it worth it to join this program?

ns4tmq,Regionals at Swayze,"My son asked to attend the games this weekend and I jumped at the chance to get some quality time in. It has however been almost 15 years since I've been to an Ole Miss baseball game and the memories I have are a bit hazy and smell of hops. As such I'm hoping some of you with more recent experience will help me out with a few details of what to expect this weekend. 

Is left field still family friendly for younger kids? I know that students get pretty rowdy in right field still but we were thinking about bringing chairs and sitting in the outfield. 

IIRC you can pretty much bring whatever you want into the student section coolers full of beer ect. Is that the case for the rest of the stadium?

Do I need to bring my clear gameday bag like we do for football or can I put our stuff into a backpack or small cooler?

Anything else I should know bringing a younger kid to a game? Tips appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/ns4tmq/regionals_at_swayze/,Knowakennedy,1,2021-06-04 09:13:23,3,/r/olemiss/comments/ns4tmq/regionals_at_swayze/

oqekut,RateMyProfessors for internships: New site by some Georgia Tech kids,"Hey everyone, I’m a recent grad over Georgia Tech - some friends and I have been working for a while on building a review site for internships/co-ops called [Canary](https://canarystudent.com/), after we got tired of: 1) Internship job postings being notoriously ""meh"" and 2.) Glassdoor providing no real info. It’s made by college students (us) and is anonymous. We're trying to democratize the whole internship process by asking questions that students actually care about, like if your work was actually impactful, what software/tools you used, etc.

I thought I'd throw it in here since hopefully y'all could find it useful as well. We really focus on user privacy as much as we can (your name/email is never displayed with the review or shared with 3rd parties).

It's blown up at a few schools, and it has a pretty solid southeastern presence (unsurprisingly) . If you want to help contribute to the project, **you can share your previous internship at** [**canarystudent.com/submit**](https://canarystudent.com/submit), it takes about 3 mins and really does help other students.

To participate in this survey you must be one of the following:

* 18+ undergraduate student who was enrolled or currently enrolled in an a class offered via Zoom, Teams, or other video conferencing software
* 18+ professor
* 18+ graduate student teaching assistant or teacher of record

oyui58,Warning about a known predator in the Oxford &amp; Ole Miss community &amp; invitation to share stories,"Out of the gate: Erin Flowers

As the school years begins, I'd like to address a known situation in Oxford and the Ole Miss campus that has been around for decades with the hopes that individuals will be wary of encounters and advances by this individual. 

Erin Flowers has been around Oxford for several decades, at least since the 90s. Most people here will probably remember him from Chick-fil-a in the old Student Union. He worked there, might still. He has worked in the bookstore, and at Petco. He is somewhere around 40 and a Black man. He went to First Baptist Church &amp; sang in the choir. Even sang the anthem at some Ole Miss baseball games. The last time I saw him was at Grace Bible Church. 

While at Ole Miss, I (male) was involved in a campus ministry for the first part of undergrad. I met Erin while in line at the Ole Miss Chick-fil-a. He recognized my shirt that said the campus ministry's name &amp; struck up a chat. Exchanged pleasantries. He was proud to see young men in church, campus ministry, such a good organization, etc. Said he went to First Baptist. He invited me to grab coffee at the Student Union just to get more familiar and chat. I agreed &amp; exchanged cell numbers (or perhaps FB, idk). As I type that, I now see how it sounds a little bizarre and out of place. I was very naive at the time &amp; didn't question much. I was sheltered at home &amp; just didn't see the odd nature of it and I didn't know about Erin's reputation that was already known in Oxford. We later on had coffee at the bookstore area &amp; just chatted about life, Ole Miss, sports. He did briefly make sexual mention at ""how you young guys are and all that"" in a joking manner. He mentioned how he'd had young guys like me, friends to come to his apt (U Trails) to do laundry in order to avoid the dorm laundry. That should've raised a red flag but y'all--I was so naive I just didn't know. It struck me as odd but I just went on. He was very chatty &amp; warm and just struck me as a good person. I was relieved once I left because it felt odd, awkward but I didn't see those predatory parts for what they were. I continued to see him in Oxford and at that Chick-fil-a but that was the one and last personal encounter with him. I think he messaged me on FB or my cell a few times but it was either something stupid or not memorable. 

Fast forward a year. I was with a few new acquaintances/friends from another campus ministry and Erin Flowers came up. One person (young male - let's call him Tim) shared that he'd know Erin through the worship at First Baptist. And the friendly, similar ""do laundry at my place"" pitch was made. Tim did go to his apt several occasions to do laundry, or I believe it was more than once. However, the final time was enough. On that occasion Erin was jokingly, but pushy and repeatedly, teasing him about having a small dick with phrases such as ""aww man show me that lil dick"". He (Erin) left to use the restroom and the Tim peeped in the bedroom to see a myriad of porn dvds/tapes scattered around the room. That's his business, but it was enough to make Tim gather his things and leave while Erin was in the restroom. 

In that same instance, another person (we'll call him Ty) shared that through that same church, Erin Flowers had been ""friendly"" around him since he'd came to Ole Miss. He also made the same ""laundry"" pitches, which Ty never took. Still yet, he recounted how Erin constantly wanted to go out to eat - specifically take him out to eat. And would oddly be at locations in Oxford where he also was. He said it didn't feel like stalking but it did not feel comfortable. He also shared that Erin would send constant messages at times wondering where he was. When Ty later on went to a different church in Oxford, Erin had, unknown to him, started attended there (Grace Bible Church) and through another person, learned that Erin was up to his old tricks.  

I have 3 other instances in which young, college-age males have similar stories. The ""laundry"" pitch is always common. If you mention that name around any of the campus ministries, you might get a head turned. And that is just within the 2012-2016 time frame. I have not idea how many other guys may have been lured into this. 

This is some random blog that mentions Erin and his creepy advances. Some of the comments are off topic, but it you get to page 4 or so, people share experiences about his advances:
https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nafoom/if-you-went-to-ole-miss-from-1994-2002ish-this-mig-t31976.html

I know this has been going on in Oxford for a while and I hope it isn't happening now. It needs calling out, still. I don't want anymore young guys in church or campus ministries to face that. I think the former preacher at First Baptist made have been made aware of Erin's predatory advances, but I don't know if he did anything about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/oyui58/warning_about_a_known_predator_in_the_oxford_ole/,gigantegiraffe28,1,2021-08-05 19:26:01,0,/r/olemiss/comments/oyui58/warning_about_a_known_predator_in_the_oxford_ole/

Things are really, really bad &amp; are about to get worse.

If you've managed to dodge the virus so far, good for you, but it's unlikely you'll be able to avoid it at a Mississippi school right now.  Please take the time to get vaccinated before coming to Oxford. It's not too late to do this before classes open, even one dose of the moderna or pfizer vaccine offers some level of protection &amp; you can get your second dose here in town. The one-dose J&amp;J (non-mRNA vaccine) protects as well.

p6m3gf,please do you part for all of us,"So with classes resuming next week and almost everyone returning to campus before then, we've sadly found ourselves in a very hard spot. while we all want to return to life as normal at school and go back to the way things were the recent spike of delta variant cases at least for me has been a cause of great concern as it should be for you. I don't think most of you fully understand how fine a line we are going to be walking especially our first couple of weeks back on campus.  The state of Mississippi as a whole is currently being devastated with delta cases and the public school systems have already seen close to 20,000 kids being forced to quarantine due to exposure to the new variant. Of course, we all want normal back and we all want to get on with life and enjoy college while we can, It has become extremely clear that we are currently in charge of our own destiny. If cases in the state continue to do what we've seen and ravage our hospital system to the point where we are reaching almost negative bed capacity we will be back to zoom U in a matter of a month. None of us wants this but sadly it has become a very real possibility especially with colleges returning already being a major fear for most around the nation. So all I ask is please do your part, mask up when in large groups. Avoid being in situations with a high potential threat of spread, if you can GET VACCINATED. Just please do your part. Like I said this is all in our hands now, how we choose to go about things is all on us. If we choose to be ignorant and ignore the asks of officials around town and school then I hope the two weeks of fun are worth the semester online. please just be smart, it shouldn't be shocking to hear how dangerously close we sit to being forced back onto a computer and if all it takes is complying for a couple of months then so be.

In the video linked above, Dr. Michael Koury, a physician in the Emergency Department at Baptist Memorial Hospital - North MS, shared his thoughts on the status of our community and health care system. He implores with our community to be cautious and protect our hospital.

Here's a brief of his remarks:

1. Hospital is under strain, and at max capacity locally (and in the region). It's difficult at this time to treat stroke and critical care/trauma patients. There is no room to supply every demand.
2. Get vaccinated. You CAN avoid life-threatening illness and hospitalization.
3. Be patient. They are doing all they can, and don't want you to have to wait either. Everyone is being seen, sickest first.
4. You can help by showing restraint in your daily life. Don't mimic social media trends. Be careful driving. Do not over indulge in alcohol. Enjoy yourself safely.
5. Stop and take inventory of your symptoms and consider whether your primary care physician (Student Health if you are a student) or an urgent care clinic may be more appropriate for your illness than the hospital's emergency department. 
6. GET VACCINATED.
7. Quarantine if you are supposed to.
8. DO NOT over indulge in alcohol or drugs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/pbfbvb/words_of_caution_from_local_er_doctor_local/,Mississippianna,1,2021-08-25 12:56:11,8,/r/olemiss/comments/pbfbvb/words_of_caution_from_local_er_doctor_local/

I never changed residency and continued to vote in state elections and pay state taxes. I hold a Mississippi driver's license, a Mississippi car registration, and my permanent address has always been in Mississippi. Despite this, the university is wanting to charge me out-of-state tuition because I worked this term.
I worked below min wage for nearly a year, so I have barely saved up. I cannot afford the out-of-state tuition and the AmeriCorps education award won't put a dent in the the out-of-state price. Does anyone have experience with this? 

Since AmeriCorps is a national service program, does Ole Miss grant exceptions for work-related gaps in residency? How does this normally work for students taking gap years or grad students on sabbatical? Is Ole Miss really going to screw me over for working AmeriCorps?

q0aoq7,I felt like Lane Kiffin figured out something at the end of the Alabama game,"Ole miss scored 21 points at the end because the Alabama defense aren't used to playing 4 quarters of football given that they usually switch out their starters once they realize they were winning

I think Lane needs to tire out the Alabama players more and give them a bait-and-switch where they do the same formations but with completely different outcomes to confuse more of the defense. It was pretty gutsy going on 4th down many times, with some of the drives end up giving up the ball on Ole Miss territory.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kiffin

Lane Kiffin's brother Chris Kiffin was at Ole Miss when they started becoming the landshark defense. They need to round up the entire Kiffin family to Ole Miss given that Monte Kiffin is also a staffed at Ole Miss

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX52cu3UxZ4&amp;list=PL4rDhuKsGKrgWcvVZNVea7TeqriQi8vX9

Not sure if anybody else watch The Season for the 2020 and for the current football season but Lane goes from being super serious with players (even after winning) to still trolling on twitter -- his demeanor seem to vary too much from Pete Carroll's playful philosophy and then suddenly switch to Nick Saban's staunch philosophy. Going back to watch previous Season episodes with Hugh Freeze, Hugh ran a lax program with a lot of 2nd-chance kids and that ended up in turmoil once there was leaked footage of the ""weed mask"" and the monetary incentives. I think Lane's seriousness is trying to keep his players in-check so they don't attract unwanted headlines with how the Hugh Freeze tenure ended. And Lane needs to figure out how to sign his players up for NIL or distribute that money evenly from Ole Miss featuring their players, etc, so that the NCAA doesn't come with sanctions again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/q0aoq7/i_felt_like_lane_kiffin_figured_out_something_at/,dizzieG,1,2021-10-03 00:29:50,3,/r/olemiss/comments/q0aoq7/i_felt_like_lane_kiffin_figured_out_something_at/

I'm currently writing a paper for uni and I'm looking for a PDF of the following book:

My college experience so far, has been at home staring at my laptop for almost 1.5 years because my cc hasn’t been open since 2020. My parents are highly suggesting that I live on campus for my first year of college, even though I’ll be a Junior, because I’ve never really had the “college experience”. They seem to believe that living off campus without certain amenities, will be too quick of an environment/social change for me (idk though). They told me to “ease” into college life and my independence, whatever that means. To be fair, I’ve never lived on my own. They also decided that I will not have a vehicle for my first year, ouch!

qrexol,Any regular events and activities for locals - not students - in the area?,"Well, I was a student but I've since withdrawn from school and just live here now. Not really a long-time local, but yeah, I need things to do anyway that's unrelated to school. I moved here during Covid which means that unfortunately I didn't get an immediate introduction to Oxford's social scene.

I'm wondering what activities, if any, there are for non-students around here. I know at the Square there are signs for various events posted regularly but I am wondering if there are any particular events that happen on a regular basis? For example I have a friend who hosts a quasar every month I believe, at which various artists' works are featured, there's guest speakers and poets, and there's typically drinks and snacks involved (I've yet to attend one yet however). A similar experience was the Secret Art Show in Tupelo though I'm unsure if that happens anymore. I haven't quite found anything like either of those, and it's difficult to keep up with anything that's happening without social media. I'd love to know if there's anything else like those events in Oxford and surrounding areas.

Are there any groups that meet up for certain activities on a regular basis or at least a somewhat set schedule? Any organizations, activist groups, hobby-specific groups, etc that meet up regularly that you know of? Are there any recreational or volunteer opportunities I can involve myself with in the area?

Basically, I'm very bored here and tired of the typical student social scene and want to know if there's anything else out there. Partying and bar-hopping has never been for me - well, actually that's a lie, I love it but it's never been *sustainable* for me I should say. I want to be able to enjoy myself and feel involved with the community without being stupid drunk. Man, I'd even be down to play some board games or go geocaching or have group picnics in the park, literally anything that helps me feel involved and passionate about something.

Also, if there's any hidden places or secret activities that typically only locals know of, please consider sharing and recruiting me into the local life even though I'm fairly new.

I wasn't sure if this post was even appropriate for the Ole Miss subreddit since many of you are new here as well lol.

I have a pretty good GPA at roughly 9.25/10, but I stand out for my ability to learn and actively engage with the knowledge I perceive, not just in academic contexts. I also think I have good extracurriculars; I was president of the student council, participated in UN models, was a scout for several years, and participated in a CISV international camp abroad.

I’m very interested in topics like physiology, immunology, zoology, genetics, neurology and pharmacology. However, this is not really the case with engineering or chemistry but it seems like the best way to get into careers that focus con research science but can also get me an outstanding salary, plus I believe I can make it thought them. 
That’s basically my career struggle, I love these biological fields but I want a career that pays well while sticking as much as possible to what I like. 

I’d like to perform jobs like developing new drugs and vaccines, curing genetic disorders, developing new therapies or studying and protecting animal life and biodiversity. I’m even considering going to med school.

Based on this, 
Do you think the programs I listed are the right ones for me at this Uni? 
Does Ole Miss stand out in any of these programs, compared to other elite public universities in the nation? 
Do you know anything about scholarships I could apply to as an international student

Sorry if this is too much but I really want to be sure I make the right call at choosing my future home for the next 4 years. I’m looking for any feedback I can get and I think hearing from the students themselves is the best source of information.

rvlc6n,Do you think we’ll ever go to an SEC Championship?,"We were close in 2014, but we had losses to LSU (7-10), Auburn (31-35), and Arkansas (0-30) that killed our chances, despite us beating Alabama for the first time since 2003. In 2015, we beat Alabama again, this time in Tuscaloosa. However we lost to Florida (10-38), Memphis (24-37), and Arkansas (52-53 in OT); and those losses killed our chances again. We still got to go to the Peach Bowl in 2014 (losing to TCU 3-42) and the Sugar Bowl in 2016 (winning against Oklahoma State 48-20). After that, we sucked until 2021 when Lane Kiffin was the coach and Matt Corral was our quarterback. We had losses to Alabama (21-42) and Auburn (20-31) that killed our SEC Championship and playoff chances but we got another Sugar Bowl berth, this time losing to Baylor (7-21) because of Matt Corral being injured and our offensive line being less-than-stellar in the game.


But do you ever think we’ll win the SEC Championship and make the College football Playoff?

It’s the most prestigious bowl one could ever attend, even when it’s a regular New Year’s Six bowl and not a CFP Semifinal location.

However despite us knocking down #1 Alabama and rising to #3, we lost to LSU, Auburn, and Arkansas, effectively ending our playoff hopes. Mississippi State was still in contention after being ranked #1 for most of October, that is until they lost to Alabama and then us. We both went to New Year’s Six bowls however. Mississippi State went to the Orange Bowl and we went to the Peach Bowl.

Around the time we lost to LSU, we were projected to go to the Fiesta Bowl by some, and iirc I also saw a few people predict the Orange Bowl for us.

* Is there a decent graduate student community, or is it mostly undergrads? Is there a community of 20s/30s folks locally or only those connected with the school?
* What's the food landscape like outside of chain restaurants?

I plan on saving up and buying a car in a few months but until then I'd prefer to live close to campus on a route where the buses travel regularly. Can someone list out the best apartment options for graduate students? My criteria are:

* Budget - $400 - 600 (all utilities included)
* I'm fine with sharing a 3 or 4 bed apartment 
* I prefer a comparatively quiet atmosphere with less undergrad partying and late-night activities. I'm a night person and do a lot of my studying at home so too much noise is really a dealbreaker.
* I've looked to see if any of the complexes around have predominantly grad students and professionals but I haven't been able to find that information
* From my research, these are some of the options I'm considering; The Quarters (formerly Campus creek), UClub, The Uncommon, Archive, Flatts. If you guys could tell me which would be the best fit for me or if you have any other suggestions that would be great.

P.S - I do have an option to move into a two-bed apartment that is being vacated this Fall by a friend of mine. It's a bit farther away from campus (off S Lamar Blvd near the North Mississippi Regional Center, so like a 10 minute drive, but I've been told the buses aren't consistent on that route). If there is anyone here with a vehicle looking for a roommate for this fall, I think that would be a really good option so please reach out. The rent is $560 minus utilities, so in total my friend says it costs him around $660 per month which is shared among two people.

uniog8,Acceptance and possible scholarship for a spring 2023 freshman?,"I have a lot of questions, as I don't really know the process of getting into colleges/Ole Miss. If there's anything you may know, please let me know, any help will be appreciated. For background knowledge, I left public school in 9th grade and have been homeschooled since then. In 10th grade I took my ACT test and scored a 20 (I was 16 there, I'm 19 now), and am planning to take at least 2 more for improvements. I now have my GED/High school equivalency degree, and finally, yes I am a Mississippi resident. Now for some of my questions...

1.) I'm planning to apply by Fall for the spring term. Can a freshman still potentially earn a scholarship even if they first enter in the spring, instead of the normal August/Autumn?

2.) Following up on question 1, for now I an only planning on doing General Studies, as I'm unsure what to major in. Will this interfere with scholarship potential?

3.) Okay, last scholarship question. I'm worried that since I don't have a highschool diploma, just the GED that I might be less likely to be picked. Is that a valid concern? Has anyone here gotten an academic scholarship, if so, how high was your ACT score? 

4.) Would anyone recommend doing the summer terms too? Is it possible to just do one summer semester, and not doing the second to have a proper ""break"" from school?

5.) Last one for now. How long would General Studies take, semesters wise? I scored high enough on my english/language arts GED portion that it said I may be eligible for college credit, but I'm not sure if that can be applied here. If anyone has experience with that either, please let me know.

With that said: 

Can you tell me a little bit about the culture of campus and/or Oxford? (School spirit, campus involvement, kindness, etc.)

What photos do you have from campus and the town? It seems beautiful from the pictures online, but I know the school strategically uses the best of the best of the pictures. 

For any former or current law students, what has the nature of your experience been? How would you describe the relationship between professors and students? Like any adversarial program, I am sure there is some competitiveness among the classes, but is it incredibly cut throat or is it a kind, yet competitive, environment?

For any former law students, what was your experience in finding a job? What is your job and location? What was your debt after graduating? If you feel comfortable sharing, what was your salary?

What is the climate and weather like in Oxford? Some of the most repeated advice I've heard from admissions counselors, deans, students, etc., is to go to school where you enjoy the climate. I love stormy weather. I really like warm, humid weather, with cold in the appropriate season.

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/ole-miss) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking. Also, since some courses depend on the professor, you can filter the reviews by professors and it will show you the average ratings for each professor.
Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.  (to leave a review, just search your course and you can submit a review at the bottom of the page)


Also, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this. And if anyone is interested in writing an article about this dm me!

vocfcv,Annual football trip - coming to the Grove,"**A little background first**:  since 2015, a group of 12-15 friends/co-workers and I take 1 week every year to go to a college town to enjoy the city, tailgate, and a game.  We have a laughable, but serious, process that we follow to identify, vet, and vote for games that we want to see.  This year we started with 204 games in the list and have finally voted to come to Oxford for the 10/15 game against Auburn. 

**Reason for my post**:  I wanted to see if you all could provide any insights into the tailgaye situation.  We are going to use a tailgate company to help us reserve a spot but...  1) what time can we officially start drinking at our tailgate? Seems like the tailgate  reservations start Friday but we are looking to charter bus down from Memphis and trying to plan our departure time. 2) best color sports coat to wear this year? 3) any reason we should come into town Friday before gameday?

vryprx,Visitors and apartments.,"Hi,

Sorry for the long read, but I could use a bit of advice. 

I am a PhD student from Denmark that gets to visit a center at the university from August to December, which I am looking very much forward to.

I am however getting a bit stressed out from looking for apartments.

I have been using the links that the International Student and Scholar services provide for looking at apartments. 

I am, mostly not by choice, a bit picky:
As I am only in the US for four months, I cant take a 12 month lease, so it would be a short term/flexible lease? I am to be honest not entirely sure what the difference between the two is.

Also it would be preferable with furnishment. My university is sponsoring the stay, but there is no budget for buying furniture.

Finally, and this is a pure choice, I would prefere a one bedroom... I am 37, and except for my wife I havent lived with somebody for a long time. I expect most students would also prefere somebody their own age as roommate. I am however also aware that this is me being demanding, and that I may have to compromise, which is fine. I am mostly there to work anyway. 

As far as I can se only the Links have available rooms, and from what I can see from the feedbacks on google and such, it dosent seem to be the best spot for me.

I have also been looking for airbnb, as my institute told me they had done that before for phd students visiting other countries, but when I look for this, that seems really expensive?

So, a couple of questions... Am I simply to late in finding anything? Are the criteria too demanding? Have I been looking the wrong places? Are there anything else I should be aware of?

Also, how is the public transportation in Oxford? I  wont be having a car, but am thinking about getting a bike. But how far fron the university I look for apartments might be depending on how easy it is to get around?",https://www.reddit.com/r/olemiss/comments/vryprx/visitors_and_apartments/,SkulperGla,1,2022-07-05 10:07:49,0,/r/olemiss/comments/vryprx/visitors_and_apartments/

I went last Tuesday, July 12 and got a lemon tattoo. I didn’t see him open the needles, I didn’t see him pour the ink, he brought someone in the same room to get a piercing while I was waiting and just changed gloves. 
He didn’t shave my leg, he didn’t wipe it down, and he didn’t wrap it before I left.
I have always tipped him well and been a good customer. I would usually never ask for my money back but the weekend after I got it, I could barely walk it was so sore. I have many tattoos. I have black and white, I have color, I have line work, I know how to care for fresh tattoos. He’s trying to tell me that there is no way it got infected because of his shop. 
He seems to think this is just how tattoos heal. My tattoo is basically gone. Even if it’s a light color, tattoos don’t disappear in a week.
Now, you might think that an apprentice did my tattoo. NOPE. It was Eric, the owner of Opus Land. I’m currently on antibiotics. Thankfully, I have healthcare and can afford them.

wh0v93,PSA to incoming freshmen/transfers: DO NOT BUY BOOKS ON THE FIRST WEEK,"I’ve been here 6 years. I have not spent a penny on a book since sophomore year.

Unless you’re taking a Chem class/lab based science that requires you to have a lab workbook, wait at minimum two weeks before you consider buying books - even if it says “required” on the syllabus.

First, actually check to see if your teacher is going to use the book in the class. You very seldom will do much the first week of class anyway and you’ll get your bearings on whether or not they’ll actually use the book after that second one.

Second, check to see if there exists online copies of the books you’re looking for prior to purchase - especially textbooks. If it’s a novel, buying hardbacks isn’t bad and sometimes helps supports the local bookstores, but I’d hold off on buying textbooks until you’re absolutely sure you’ll need it.

Is there any place I can buy campus apparel for cheaper ($30 is the most I'd be willing to pay for a single piece and that's on the higher end of my budget). Used does not matter. I've heard FB marketplace could have some stuff too but I haven't had any luck yet.

Tried Lamar park once, but didn't really like the vibe, was more of a soccer mom vibe and despite it being busy, I was the only one running.

I graduated in the spring of 2020 and am now attending grad school online (not Ole Miss). I would really love to find some study spots around Ole Miss and Oxford in general that I can frequent. :) I would like to find somewhere that is relatively quiet (i.e., not a busy, loud area) and that has wi-fi, but I am not opposed to just downloading everything I need before leaving the apartment! I know I can probably study on campus in either libraries, but I’m not 100% what the parking situation is like these days, especially for non-students. Plus, I really don’t want to take up any paid parking that students might need because I know they oversell tf out of the parking passes, which forces some students to park in the paid parking areas.
