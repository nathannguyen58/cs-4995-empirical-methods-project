bjze2m,Transfer Question.,"I am transferring from SFCC to WSU next fall. I've already been through orientation and signed up for classes in the fall. Currently I am taking 15 (3 classes) credits at SFCC. However, one of the classes I realized I will not need and I am doing kinda poorly in. I still can drop the class but it would put a withdrawal on my transcript but will not affect my GPA.

bk4bay,"Does Anyone Else Feel like They Haven't ""Learned"" Anything?","Okay...so I transferred to WSU global campus after finishing my associates from Whatcom Community College. I've been a full time college student since beginning in April of 2016, summer semester/quarter every year. 

Finished my associates with a solid 4.0 Cumulative GPA....and now I'll be graduating from WSU with a bachelors in integrated strategic communications....finishing with a 3.9 GPA overall. 


The problem is, I honestly feel as though I have learned nothing. I am not complaining, as I am sure my approach hasn't been the healthiest. If anything, I've learned that I can handle any tasks thrown at me, and given the minimal effort I've applied, I can actually do quite well when it is necessary......

I transferred into WSU with an ironclad bundle of scholarships and grants, only had to take out two smallish loans, but was it worth $10,000 overall? Hopefully this bloody degree opens some [trap] doors for me. 


Anyone else have this experience? More or less?

I'm just venting.

bn208x,Screw WSU For Not Letting Me Print,"Little bit of a rant. Yesterday I discovered that I can't print anything even though I have LITERALLY $18 OF PRINTING FUNDS just because for summer I am taking 3 online classes that are technically through global campus instead of Pullman campus. So, I've basically lost all of that money because it will just be absorbed back into the system when I graduate (I graduate after summer class completion). I was/am pissed off because I was trying to print my course schedules for my online classes, and it turned into a 20 minute fiasco with cougar copies trying to figure out why it wouldn't work before we realized there's probably some sort of technology fee that I didn't pay because of online classes.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I just think it's bs that I ended up having to pay $3 (card minimum) to get cougar copies to print 3 pages, when I have $18 in my printing account. It's literally not that big of a deal, but just the principle of it pisses me off.  


I also think that putting printing money in should be optional-- they shouldn't force you to put in $7.50 every semester.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/bn208x/screw_wsu_for_not_letting_me_print/,bcoug,28,2019-05-10 14:38:41,18,/r/wsu/comments/bn208x/screw_wsu_for_not_letting_me_print/

bwielc,PSA for incoming First-years,"Here is a short list for how to not suck at living on campus

1. Make friends with (or at least try to be kind to) your RAs, RTA, and AHD; even if they are extremely annoying and in your face. Try to be amicable with your roommate as well...
2. Talk to your RA about what it takes to become an RA or an RTA. I've had lots of friends that worked as RAs and they either loved it or hated it. Either way, they were paid with rent and food...which can be worth it. As to being an RTA, it pays your rent and doesn't require as many hours as an RA does; speaking from personal experience, it is a pretty slick gig. For me and many others, it was a gateway into Information Technology.
3. GET INVOLVED. Go to the All-Campus events and find some cool clubs to join. If you don't like going to All-Campus events, visit the Student Org Center in CUB 331 and ask them about some clubs to join.
4. Find a balance in school and friends. Personally, 12-15 credits was about as much as I could handle while having friends over to my apartment every weekend. Your mileage may vary.
5. WORK OUT. USE YOUR UREC MEMBERSHIP. I know you aren't starting classes before 9am, so go ahead and work out before class. 7:30 isn't really all that early to work out, and the gyms are usually pretty empty. There is a gym within a 5 minute walk from every ResHall, roll out of bed at 7:30, workout, shower, grab some food, then get to your 9am class. You'll be ready to tackle the day, now that you've accomplished an important factor.
6. The 40% discount on RDA products is kind of a sham. For a $10 item, you pay $6 out of your RDA, which looks great! Until you factor in the $900 charge at every level just to have the account. So your $10 item probably ends up costing about $10 with that base charge. If your parents want to ""send you money for FOOD ONLY"", like mine did, then show them how to add CougarCash to your account. They can follow [this link](https://livingat.wsu.edu/cardinfo/deposit/default.aspx?mode=CC) to add CougarCash to your account WITHOUT you having to give them your password.
7. DO NOT GIVE ANYONE YOUR PASSWORD. Not your parents, not your friends, and most definitely not that SexyTinderRobot. That passwords gets you access to EVERYTHING at WSU. It might be ""easier"" for everyone if you give your parents your password so they can pay your tuition, but there are ways they can do it online or by mail without compromising your security.
8. Socialize. Your room is likely between 200 and 300 square feet, get out. Don't study there, don't drink there, don't eat there, your dorm should be for sleeping only. Study at the library, drink at the apartment/house/frat parties, eat in the dining centers, make your dorm room your zen place where you come home to feel warm and safe at night to sleep.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/bwielc/psa_for_incoming_firstyears/,jaxder_jared,43,2019-06-03 20:45:27,39,/r/wsu/comments/bwielc/psa_for_incoming_firstyears/

Taking the GMAT could provide me with great opportunities at other local schools, e.g. University of Oregon - Portland, University of Portland, but then I wouldn't start graduate school until Fall 2020 to 2021.

My biggest concerns are availability of parking and price. The blue lot is obviously the cheapest but I worry that parking will be competitive and it will be difficult to find a spot some days based on some other threads here.

ch0nhp,Advice for incoming Business Students,"I'd imagine a lot of what I have to say here is applicable to more than just people focusing on business, but I don't want to speak for anything with which I am not familiar. For a bit of context, I graduated in December 2016 with a double major in Accounting and Finance and have been working in accounting ever since graduation. 2 months ago, I started working in the finance department for a very promising startup, and wanted to share some advice to future cougs.

First, nothing is guarenteed from a WSU degree, but that doesn't mean you can't make anything out of a WSU degree. It's a school where you get out what you put in, I know a lot of people who went on to great positions at great companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Boeing, KPMG) you name it, they went there. I also know a lot of people who didn't take things as seriously, and struggled to find work and especially struggled to find work in their field. Companies want to hire Cougs, but they only want to hire the best, this advice is meant to be for people who want to standout and put things on their resumes that recruiters are looking for.

1. Get good grades. Some people say this doesn't matter-it does. I know a lot of companies won't look at resumes unless you have a 3.5+ GPA. Freshman year, don't let the allure of easy classes be an excuse to get ""just fine"" grades. Take advantage of easy classes a 4.0 in one of those classes is worth just as much as a 4.0 in a Junior/Senior class. Build a strong foundation and to improve your chances later on in life.

2. Surround yourself with hardworking people. College lets you redefine your friend group, make friends with people in classes specific to your major, chances are you will have a lot of classes with them over the next few years. Find people who you can push to be their best, and they can push you to be your best. If you surround yourself with people wanting to party 5 times a week, you are going to want to do the same. 

3. Join organizations. Student involvement (and leadership) is a big factor in the job search and the internship search, join clubs related to your major, and don't be afraid to join professional business organizations. WSU has Alpha Kappa Psi and Delta Sigma Pi, both are great at developing your professionalism, networking with other hardworking people, will help develop your resume and will give you leadership opportunities. 

4. Go to career events. The Carson College puts on a LOT of developmental programs. Talks from different companies, career nights, speakers, resume builders. All of these are great opportunities, and if you take advantage of them, you'll be in a much better place.

WSU is a fun place, it helps you develop yourself and lets you be who you want to be. Be stupid, but don't let that jeopardize your future, prioritize what needs to be a priority, and have fun on the side.

I was awarded a scholarship for this year and mailed in my paperwork to accept it (I live in Tri-Cities and go there) back in May, and had been waiting for confirmation and for it to show up in my financial aid section on myWSU, but it never did. I just finished spending almost 3 weeks emailing back and forth with Pullman and talking to Tri-Cities financial aid about it and finally found out that the person who'd been responsible for them was no longer working there, and oh, quite a few students who mailed paperwork in had it go missing.

I got an apologetic email from the new person there *(today, July 24)*, who asked me to send in another copy *(eh, ok)* to her by Friday, June 26 ***(not ok...)***. I sent her PDF's of my papers since it's not really possible for the postal service to get there that fast.

We both struggled as students and left college with loans and credit card debt. It made the years after graduation a game of ‘catch-up’. It affected where we could live after grad (the ‘burbs was cheaper than the city) and meant we had to be super strict with our budgeting post grad (..ramen and lentils, anyone?). The point is, if we can help anyone start saving and thinking about this stuff a little earlier, we can save you stress and struggle. And you can learn from our pain.

I live in Vancouver, so I decided to apply for WSUV.  Now, I'm panicking.  I know you can only apply to one campus, and that you can't move your acceptance from one to another, but I can go back and change my form.  More than anything I want to experience dorm life and all that surrounds it, and I'm worried I won't have much of a community at WSUV since it's a commuter school, and I'm a very social person, I go mad if I haven't hung out with a friend in a couple of days.

I've heard a rumor from one of my dad's friends that works in government that WSU is moving their main campus to Vancouver, and building a football stadium, dorms, etc.  but it's just that, a rumor.  I can't find anything to back it up online but it's confusing me so much on which campus to apply to.

czar01,Chemistry Education Research Needs Student Participants," Hi! My name is Kristin Hughes; I am a doctoral student at Northeastern University, and a high school chemistry and math teacher in the Seattle area. For my dissertation, I am studying the ways in which high school chemistry curricula can better prepare students for college chemistry courses. Though similar research exists, it fails to include student voice, which I consider to be the most important thing in educational research. My research is designed to help students and to do so effectively, I believe they must be included in the research process. 

To that end, I am looking to recruit recent \[within 5 years\] high school graduates who took high school chemistry, and who have taken an introductory \[preparatory or general\] chemistry course within the past 6 quarters \[or 3 semesters\], not including summer sessions; I am looking to speak with students from as many different demographics as possible, so these are the only eligibility requirements. I am asking you to complete an online questionnaire \[found at [https://goo.gl/forms/gjFm74F9LMpuUy0t2](https://goo.gl/forms/gjFm74F9LMpuUy0t2) \] and indicate if you are willing to be contacted for a follow-up interview, for which you will be given a $25 Amazon gift card as a thank you for your time. The questionnaire itself is completely confidential- I do not ask for any identifying information unless you are willing to be contacted for a follow-up interview; you do not have to answer this request for your email address if you do not want to be contacted. 

Thank you for considering this request. I strongly believe in the necessity of including students voice in educational research and would appreciate your help in allowing me to do just that. If you have any further questions about me or my research, please do not hesitate to ask. You can respond to me here or email me at [hughes.k@husky.neu.edu](mailto:hughes.k@husky.neu.edu).

Thank you,

Kristin Hughes

dnjcey,Question for business majors!,"Hey guys! Quick question for those of you majoring in business (cause if I email my advisor it will take at least 3 weeks for a response). I didn’t study abroad, so I’m looking to finish up the international requirement through taking two international classes, one within the college and one non-business. For the past year I assumed I would have to take another international business class beyond I_BUS 380, because the academic progress system doesn’t show that specific class as an option for fulfillment. However, on multiple pages of the Carson College website, they list I_BUS 380 as eligible for that requirement.. Sooo, does anybody have experience with this and does it actually count in the end? Which information is wrong?

2. Which one has a better community vibe, or are they both kind of unique to themselves?

I've just transferred from UW to study computer engineering here. UW rather infamously teaches Java in their intro series, which I have completed.

Wondering if anyone here has a higher level understanding of the major/system here and can let me know if I should jump into C++ (cpts 122 or 223) or stick with java?

esw06s,"Housing questions for a transfer student, (24M) Fall 2020. Apartments vs Resident Halls","Hi everyone. I’m hoping to be transferring to WSU for the Fall 2020. There seem to be so many options for housing and I want to get the most out of my living situation. But I seems to come down to do I want to live in a residential hall or an off campus apartment. I would definitely appreciate some advice from people living in Pullman right now with the pros and cons of their living situation.

I’m a little older, 24M, and I’m sort of used to living more independently, so I’m not too sure dorm life would be best for me. I’d rather not share a room, but it seems like some halls offer single bedrooms. I also will have a car and it seems like it would be difficult to find parking for a vehicle while living in a hall. There is the bus system, idk how efficient that is though. It also looks really fun to be involved in a residential hall community. It may be harder connect with people if I live in an apartment far off campus?

I’m still researching, but it seems like living in like the Dabco apartment area(like Emerald/Church Hill Downs Apartments), with involving myself in Greek life/clubs might be best. Or finding a residential hall that has a single room, and can have decent parking near for when I do use my car. For driving to get like groceries and go places. What are your guy’s experiences with apartment or dorm living? Thanks for any advice or recommendations!

Cost isn’t to much of an issue for me right now.

ewevie,I need a how-to guide on making friends at WSU,"As the title says, I don't really know anyone here. I transferred here last semester but failed to really get to know anyone. Everyone says ""join a club"" but half of these clubs don't seem to be having regularly scheduled meetings, many of which have been inactive for years. To be honest, I want to go to a party lol, but i'm not sure if I'd even be able to get in without knowing the right people or just showing up by myself. Not against paying to get in, but will I be turned away if I'm by myself?

Trying to meet people in my classes also seems difficult as compared to my old school, the lecture style format makes it hard to really strike up conversation.

ewt6di,Transfer Questions,"Hello, I'm an 18 year old student at Shoreline Community College in WA. I'm looking at transferring to WSU as a computer science major, but I have some questions. It says that you need to have a GPA of 2.5 overall to be admitted to WSU, however due to unfortunate events in my personal and family lives, last year was extremely difficult for me to tackle, thus resulting in my GPA being very low. I've been recovering since and right now have a 2.45 GPA overall. My question is if I should apply now, to make it in time for the priority deadline, or wait until the end of this quarter, where I'll be able to close some 0s and noticeably improve my GPA. 

The thing is that GPA in my computer science classes is actually good, averaging at around 3.4 and my calculus 1 class has a 3.2 GPA as well. I failed calculus 2 a couple of times, therefore retaking it right now as well as taking physics. What makes it confusing to me, is if they'll only look at the GPA at the moment of application during the evaluation process or look at the GPA after the application too. 

Another thing that makes it confusing is the fact that my college has a direct transfer agreement with WSU, where it states that if the student graduated with an Associates Degree with a 2.5 or higher, it's guaranteed admission (at the school, not department of course). 

So which is it? Do they only look at the GPA at the moment of application to evaluate you, or do they also look at what grades you got after you applied. Does it make sense to apply now or to wait until this quarter is finished?

exszz3,Student Leadership Opportunity: Helping Homeless Communities,"**Hearts for the Homeless International** is a student-led nonprofit organization that provides free blood-pressure screening opportunities and heart health education to homeless populations around the United States and globally. We are a team of undergraduate students, medical students, PhD students, medical doctors, and other professionals who are invested in improving the well-being of homeless communities around the world- including yours. H4H was originally founded by students at the University of Central Florida and has since grown into an international organization with over 15 chapters across the United States, Brazil, and India. With your passion, we aim to work with you to help you positively impact your homeless community. Together, we can better fulfill our goal of improving the condition of humanity! 

We are **interested in working with student leaders** who want to innovate, to serve, and to enact change. For student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time, leadership, and compassion. We will take care of the rest. The lives you will change, the friends you will make, and the experiences you will gain will be invaluable.

The work of our students has helped so many, and for this reason, it has been recognized by the US Congress, the Brazilian government, President Clinton, educational and medical institutions, and other non-profit institutions as well.

f4o16k,Portland State University or Washington State University Vancouver,"Hi Everyone,
I currently attend Clark College and am hoping to find the best suitable school between Washington State University Vancouver and Portland State University that will provide a good mix of training in graphic design/UX/UI. UX/UI is more important to me over graphic design if I had to choose, but I think it would be valuable if I were trained in all areas. The two programs I am looking at are the Digital Technology and Culture program at WSUV and the Graphic Design program at PSU. I heard the DTC program does not teach graphic design per se but has a high job placement rate, and that some of PSU’s graphic design alumni have successfully worked in UX/UI afterward. Additionally, I would also like to study as much Japanese as I can. I currently take Japanese courses at Clark College and love it. I investigated and found out that WSUV would allow me to finish out the remainder of Clark’s Japanese offerings as a global studies minor, but that PSU has a full-blown Japanese program that I could earn a minor in. I have considered other factors such as post-graduation and alumni connections. If I receive schooling in Vancouver I will have access to connections in my area post-graduation and even a little before graduation, but if I receive schooling at PSU, I have connections with professors at Clark that are alumni from PSU and will have more of a connection with Portland’s community after I graduate. This is pretty important considering Portland has more of an art scene and the jobs that go along with a bigger city, although not being where I live which is a bit inconvenient. I live in Vancouver, Washington and am admitted for Fall of 2020 to Portland State University as a Co-enrolled student with Clark College. I am also admitted to WSUV for fall of 2020. I am set to graduate with an associate in arts direct transfer degree this June meaning that Spring Quarter will be my last quarter at Clark for that degree. The cost of college is the biggest hurdle I have when deciding which school to attend. Because of this, I filled out my FAFSA soon after it was available and have done the scholarship applications for both schools to try to maximize the highest award amount I can. I cannot afford college and am currently 100% funded by the Pell Grant, so any additional money is extremely valuable as I cannot work. I have a 3.98 g.p.a., but do not know how much this will help regarding scholarship awards. All in all, I would really appreciate hearing everyone’s experiences with their school—either WSUV or PSU, the DTC program at WSUV or the Graphic Design program at PSU, whether or not they felt prepared when they finally dove into their related career, and if they felt their school was the right decision for them all things considered.

We'll be running a parlor larp rather than a sports larp.  Parlor larps use things like rock-paper-scissors, dice, or cards, to determine the result of challenges, rather than swinging around foam swords and the like.  One of the great things about this being the accessibility for all players.

fi3p8h,WSU Commits to Online courses for duration of Spring Semester," [Post Source](https://www.facebook.com/notes/wsu-pullman/wsu-pullman-commits-to-distance-learning-throughout-spring-semestercancels-moms-/3145286568837260/)  


Following guidance provided by Washington Governor Jay Inslee on Thursday, Washington State University has decided that its [\#Pullman](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/pullman?source=note&amp;epa=HASHTAG) campus will continue to use distance learning methods for the duration of the spring semester. 

[\#WSU](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/wsu?source=note&amp;epa=HASHTAG) had previously left open the possibility of a return to face-to-face teaching in Pullman at some point during the spring 2020 semester. The [WSU Pullman](https://www.facebook.com/WSUPullman/?eid=ARCcVFXcyyAvLflX9FB2FR_UIZTr6siJ3kHhPbxChQ8_BIQYfxR0cpM_ZzTlvq53PWNU7eOx7JHXjwKS) campus will remain open during this period and residential, dining and healthcare facilities will continue to operate. This decision only impacts WSU Pullman at this time. 

The University’s other four campuses may still return to in-person teaching prior to the end of the semester, depending on local needs and approval by local public health officials.   
 

In addition, WSU Pullman has canceled its annual [\#WSUMomsWeekend](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/wsumomsweekend?source=note&amp;epa=HASHTAG) festivities, which had been scheduled for early April. This move was made in accordance with guidance from state health officials to limit large gatherings in light of the growing COVID-19 pandemic.

The University will contact the promoter of the Macklemore concert scheduled for April 4 to determine the status of that performance. 

A decision regarding WSU Pullman’s May 9 Commencement exercises will be made closer to the event date.

fitm27,Concerned about online classes,"Is anyone else a little worried about online classes? I never really thought about it but what if for some reason the internet goes down or the power? Is it realistic to think that the internet companies in the state could end up out of business from this virus? What if they cannot work to fix issues? 

Some of my professors seem a little too strict and will only offer tests and quizzes during a zoom session. Well I live in a family of 5 and everyone is on the internet now since schools are closed so what if I literally cannot connect into lecture because of poor bandwidth? We already pay for the fastest internet we can and it still is slow. I’ll have to email my professors and tell them I have internet issues and I’m worried I can’t watch zoom sessions. 

Am I being realistic here? Power/internet companies going out? Zoom sessions possibly too hard to watch because 5 other family members are on the internet? I live out in the sticks not the city that is why my internet is bad. What do you think would happen if many students lost power or lost internet access for significant periods of time?

flln8o,"Allow WSU Students to pick if they would like grades to be PASS/FAIL or GRADED ex: (A,B,C)","Hello Cougs,
These last two weeks, Washington State University (WSU) and many universities globally have had to transition to digital learning with lectures, discussions, and labs going entirely ONLINE. Students no longer have access to in-person office hours, study sessions, tutoring, and other academic resources, which are much needed for most (if not all) classes at WSU. During this global pandemic, classes are transitioning to digital learning, and there are many resources that won't be offered, which makes it extremely difficult to attain passing grades, let alone A’s or a B’s has become extremely arduous. The world is undergoing a global pandemic, and this only adds to the stress that continues to affect students' studies while Washington State currently has the most reported deaths and the second state with the largest COVID-19 reports, which can be found at  https://ncov2019.live 

Many Families and Students are feeling the pressure from being forced to work/learn while handling a global pandemic. The current conditions at supermarkets and any public environment are hectic, and many families cannot buy essentials/needs because of the high demands and low access/resources currently offered, especially to low-income households. This is a burden to students, their friends, and family. Therefore, we call for the option to allow WSU Students to pick whether they would like grades to be PASS/NO-PASS or GRADED WORK like (A-, B, C, etc). We believe students should pick because it is essential to do what's best for the student, their future, and their success here at WSU. Students who choose Pass/Fail will have no effect on their GPA; however, if you decide Graded work, then it will be based on your letter grades. We understand many students want to get their honors, graduate school requirements, and so on and that is why we believe this is the best option for all of us. We hope professors can be lenient and understanding throughout this time to help with the transition but we have to understand that we cannot perform to the extent the university is asking of us all during this time. Many petitions are being heard at universities like USC, UC Berkeley, and other American institutions, while institutions like the University of Toronto HAS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED THESE CHANGES.

We hope that Washington State University, Kirk Schulz, Mary Jo Gonzales, Jill Creighton, and The WSU Regents consider making this change for the health and well-being of their students in a time of high levels of stress and considerable uncertainty. This is a time where many students have had to return home while taking all their belongings. Many students will have to continue paying rent because their contract lasts until mid-late May-July without any income because their jobs are closed down for precautionary reasons. Please support your students and their families. THERE ARE STUDENTS STRUGGLING AND THIS CAN HELP THEM TREMENDOUSLY.

PLEASE SIGN YOUR NAME TODAY! 

Thank you to all the universities pushing this like UC Davis, Berkeley and those who helped me with this. Thank you to the WSU students and their thoughts and opinions as well. As Always, Go Cougs!

fnq53v,Information security is even more important now.,"Because WSU has moved most everything to online for the foreseeable future, as an information security person, I wanted to take a second to remind everyone of the technical threats.

The bad people of the world are taking advantage of Covid-19. They are using every threat vector (phishing, spam, malware, ransomware, etc). If you are spending more time in front of a screen (and let's just face facts -- you are going to be spending more time in front of a screen), please take the time to review the following to ensure you're as safe as you can be. Don't stop reading now because you feel you know this already.

\- Make sure your software is updated. I'm not just referring to your operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux). All of your software. Many of the threats we see take advantage of software besides operating systems.

\- Use strong passwords. Use a password manager. I recommend Lastpass. You can also use Keepass. Both are good. Use different passwords for different accounts.

\- Use anti-virus and anti-malware software and ensure that both are updated regularly - preferably automatically.

\- Make sure your home router uses a strong password and has a firewall configured. Also ensure that your Wifi is password protected using WPA2 or WPA3.

\- Use encryption on your personal device.

\- If you didn't know the attachment was coming, treat it as hostile and DON'T OPEN IT until you've confirmed it is safe. Don't confirm it is safe by responding via email. Pick up the phone and call the person. If you can't call them, it's not safe.

\- Before you click that link in email, ask yourself if clicking it is worth the risk of malware, financial loss, identity theft, or some combination thereof.

\- No aristocrats, lawyers, or long lost princes need any help moving millions through your bank account. The IRS won't contact you via email or phone regarding your taxes. Your bank won't close your account or charge you fees for not confirming your password. WSU is not making changes to email and/or websites that requires you to login or else. Websites can't detect if you have a virus on your computer. Rich busy people don't send unsolicited messages to total strangers looking for remote part-time assistants to generously spend money for them. The illuminati is not taking over your daily life. If it seems too good to be true, it is too good to be true.

Stay safe out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/fnq53v/information_security_is_even_more_important_now/,Network_Guardian,1,2020-03-23 15:25:10,1,/r/wsu/comments/fnq53v/information_security_is_even_more_important_now/

Although WSU is a legitimate accredited institution, I do have friends that go there and I also know a lot of people that ended up leaving WSU to go to UW. WSU has a very low bar of entry, abysmal student retention rate, major lack of diversity, countless racist incidents, companies unwilling to hire WSU alumni and the stigma of being a WSU alumni, I can't believe that counselors and advisers would offer such a place as a suggestion when there are hundreds of other respectable institution of higher learning out there that have modest admission requirements and are still respected by the industry and greater society.

ftivc4,admissions concerns,"i'm super nervous about my wsu admissions decision. i felt that i had a pretty good chance of getting in, but hadn't heard anything from the school besides being told my application would be reviewed in the march review period.

so, i checked my application status on myWSU on the 30th, and it said that my application had been last updated that day. myWSU said that my application review was complete and that my application review had been mailed to me, but did not give me a yes or no. i figured it wasn't a big deal (even though i want to know if i've gotten in or not) because it had only been updated that day and it would take a while for any sort of mail to be delivered (plus complications due to covid-19). however, a friend of mine applied to wsu around the same time as i, and received an email with a banner congratulating her on her acceptance (however, she received this email a few weeks ago, pre-shutdown of everything due to covid-19). i haven't received any sort of email, and this fact alone has me super concerned. it would make sense that it says my admissions decision has been mailed if i was denied acceptance to the school- they would just send me a denial letter, right? however, even if i was denied, i think it's odd there was no denial email sent along with any letter that may have been mailed. also, on myWSU, it says i have 1 unread message in my comm. center, but when i click it, there are no new messages.

ftto2l,Pullman Regional Hospital cuts employee pay by 25% to offset drop in revenue due to pandemic," via Pullman Radio News

&gt;Pullman Regional Hospital has cut employee pay by 25% to try to deal with a significant drop in revenue caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Washington Governor Jay Inslee has ordered hospitals to suspend elective surgeries and limit outpatient procedures to increase healthcare capacity for a possible coronavirus surge.  The order has significantly decreased revenue to PRH.  
&gt;  
&gt;PRH has implemented a coronavirus financial management plan, according to a press release from the hospital.  Officials remain committed to avoiding layoffs, but the hospital has cut hourly pay and salaries by 25% for 2 months starting with the April 11th pay period.  
&gt;  
&gt;The move will create a million dollars in cash savings which will be used to pay for operations.  PRH has 64 days cash on hand.  Officials are hoping the pay cut will allow the hospital to have at least 30 days cash on hand.  
&gt;  
&gt;PRH is also implementing unpaid furloughs for employees, capping organizational overtime, limiting paid time off and suspending cash reimbursement for paid leave that hasn’t been taken.

These are hard times but thinking of all my good memories in Pullman make me happy and make it easier to push through.

Stay healthy, GO COUGS!

gbrlo9,Malicious Email Analysis: The famous part-time job scam,"Good afternoon Cougs. Let's take a look at another scam that seems to be propagating in our inboxes. The famous part-time job scam. This one comes around on a fairly constant basis, and in the last couple of weeks seems to be showing up frequently.

It will usually sound something like this (though to be fair, I made this one up to make my points):

\* Begin bad email \*

\[Nameless greeting\]

My name is \[some very important sounding person with impressive sounding title\]. I am so very busy because I'm rescuing cute kittens from trees, curing cancer using half a tuna sandwich, and negotiating world peace by playing board games at the United Nations. I can't possibly do everything I need to do, so I chose you to be my personal assistant. It pays $300 per week. You only need to do some light filing, mail letters, and handle transactions on my behalf. It is only a few hours per week.

Please reply to me at superhumanhero135@\[some free email provider\]

\* End bad email \*

Let's break this down.

1. People with very busy jobs and important titles don't email total strangers to select an assistant. Personal assistants are trusted people that make very important decisions on behalf of their employer. This job doesn't have that vibe.

2. If they are interested in you to be their assistant, they will most likely give you the courtesy of using your name.

3. Don't be enticed by the idea of easy money. If you fall for this scam, there is a chance you could find yourself involved in money laundering and mailing illegal goods, and you will be held responsible for it. If it's not these things, there is a much greater likelihood that you could also find yourself scammed out of money. How it works: The scammer sends you checks to deposit. It takes around 48 hours for a bank to confirm if a check is valid or not. During that time, the scammer asks you to take some of that money and send it to another account. Once the check is discovered as fraudulent, the bank reverses the deposit, and you are also still responsible for the money you sent, leaving you scammed out of your own money, and no way to recover it.

4. If the person is so important, there is a very high likelihood that they will not use Outlook, Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo, or some other free email service provider for important work related stuff. Such things should make you very suspicious. In addition, most of these emails are sent from compromised email accounts. Any truthful person wouldn't be sending such an important message through someone else's account.

In conclusion, if you receive an email like this, it's a scam.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/gbrlo9/malicious_email_analysis_the_famous_parttime_job/,Network_Guardian,1,2020-05-01 18:12:07,11,/r/wsu/comments/gbrlo9/malicious_email_analysis_the_famous_parttime_job/

gff88o,Malicious Email Analysis: Bluffing blackmail/extortion scams,"Good afternoon Cougs. Time for another episode of examining digital evil. There is no end to the creativity of bad people. In this case, these particular scams usually contain the following elements:

\- The mysterious yet sinister ""I know stuff"" / ""I have your info"" threat

\- A piece of information that is supposedly proof

\- The shaming threat

\- Payment information

\- ""Don't try anything to stop me""

Let's take a look at how this scam works. As usual, I have written my own example to ensure we cover the security bases (though to be fair, my grammar and punctuation is markedly superior to what is in their emails).

&amp;#x200B;

**\* Begin bad email \***

*You don't know me. But, I know you. I know that your password is \[ONE OF YOUR ACTUAL STOLEN PASSWORDS\]. Let's get down to business. A while ago, I installed software on a baking site that allowed me to get access to your computer and watch you through your computer camera while you were visiting. I recorded you drooling over the sight of that cherry cheesecake, and I recorded video of it while recording the video you were watching (yes, it's you watching the video). I'm a businessman, and I see this as a business opportunity. You have two options here.*

*The first is that you can ignore this email, and I will send this video to every person in your contact list. Think of the shame you will experience forever when all the most important people in your life will now know what sort of hidden passions you experience in your free time. What kind of awkwardness would you have to endure when they find out you really like to wear plaid hats while staring at cheesecake?*

*The second option is that I can make this all go away. You just need to send me $913 worth of Bitcoin to the following wallet address: \[Bitcoin wallet address here\]. After confirming payment, I will remove all trace of my software from your computer and leave you alone for the rest of your life.*

*Don't try to contact the police. They can't help you. I control your entire computer and will know if anyone tries to find me, in which case, I will release the video immediately. You have three days from the time you open this email.*

**\* End bad email \***

&amp;#x200B;

To start with, the only part of this email that should worry you is the stolen password. Stolen passwords are sold by the millions on dark web sites every day. These are generally acquired in bulk from large scale security breaches, which is precisely why the password presented in the email is usually a correct password. If the password in the email matches one that you use regularly, you need to change that password immediately -- like right now. Stop reading this, and go change it. You can come back to this afterward.

Next, it is extraordinarily unlikely that the sender knows anything about you. While my write up is goofy and ridiculous, the subject matter that the scammer will use often revolves around sex, pornography, and other activities that people would certainly be embarrassed about and not want known. This sort of threat would be enough to make some people cringe. But, these sorts of messages are scams. Unfortunately, it only takes a few people who really are scared of such information being leaked that the scam often brings in over $10,000 per month or more for the scammer -- definitively lucrative enough to encourage them to keep doing it.

If you receive one of these messages, they don't have control over your computer, they'll never know if you opened the email (unless you allow it to send a read receipt -- which I've never seen happen in a scam email), and if you do anything to ask for help, the scammer will never know. In this case, report it to [abuse@wsu.edu](mailto:abuse@wsu.edu) and let the security team take a look at it.

As always, use a password manager to ensure that you use a different password for every site you are a part of (today is World Password day -- don't bother trying to find any sort of greeting card though). Be suspicious of what arrives into your inbox.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/gff88o/malicious_email_analysis_bluffing/,Network_Guardian,1,2020-05-07 17:06:44,3,/r/wsu/comments/gff88o/malicious_email_analysis_bluffing/

ggss2w,"If the university thought my friend cheated on her final, would they have let her know by now?","My friend took a final on Monday on Crowdmark while in her university apartment. The exam did not use Proctotio and the prof never said the exam was proctored. The directions said she could use ""class notes"" on the exam but never defined what this meant. They also said a failure to follow to follow instructions would mean a 0 and a report to the Conduct board, which also included a restriction on ""other websites"".

The prof gave the class some old exams as PDFs to study beforehand and she thought about using these (and had them open on tabs for about six or seven minutes after opening the exam, filling out a problem or two) before deciding against them and closing them before completing her final, taking the pictures, and sending them to her prof to upload for her because there was a glitch with Crowdmark or something. But the time passed and the prof had accidentally uploaded the pics incorrectly, and was notified, and told my friend that they would take care of it.

She's been worried out of her wits for the past week about being flagged for cheating. I've tried to tell her that no one was watching her because the exam wasn't proctored and the university watching her through her VPN or something without letting her know would be a violation of the privacy policy, but she refuses to believe it. She's also worried they could have been watching her through her webcam even though it never turned on during her exam, which would require a team of hackers or something that WSU obviously doesn't have.

It's been five days. If the university thought she cheated, they would have let her know by now, right? I think WSU would've been on top of that and told her ASAP.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/ggss2w/if_the_university_thought_my_friend_cheated_on/,throughaway_student,1,2020-05-09 22:06:36,0,/r/wsu/comments/ggss2w/if_the_university_thought_my_friend_cheated_on/

gitx02,Unexpected grade,"Hey all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I took Political Research Methods (pols 201) last semester and expected to get an A but ended up with a B instead. The class is graded upon 5 problem sets (28%, lowest of 5 dropped), Discussions (12%, 1% each discussion), Midterm/Final (40%), and a research critique (20%). 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a 10/10 for ever discussion, except one I didn't turn in. I got a 100/100 on 3 problem sets and an 86% on one, and didn't turn in the fifth because it would be dropped. I got a 110/100 and 95/100 on the midterm and final, and 100/100 on the research critique. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something? This was my first semester at WSU, I transferred from a community college. I'm not really upset about a B, just caught off guard and want to make sure I don't get another surprise going forward.

gjceda,My first impressions of WSU and Pullman after visiting there,"I had an opportunity to drive down to Pullman and Moscow to check out the schools recently despite the ongoing pandemic. After all the criticism I hear about WSU, I just thought that why don't I just drop by and check it out! I have to say that WSU's campus looks surprisingly more modern than many other public universities I have seen. Weather in the area, was kind of gloomy when I was there considering it was like early spring. Kind of reminded me of Seattle in a way with the rain clouds looming over the area but I can't speak for how the weather is like during the summer, fall and winter months. I have to say University of Idaho is quite a bit smaller to WSU and it  resembles more of a branch school rather than a large public university. Pullman itself felt like a decently medium size town with the essential amenities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Considering I went during the lockdown, there were quite a few students there but I didn't really notice any party vibes or any binge drinking scene that WSU is so notorious for. You guys have redeemed yourself from the party school reputation maybe because WSU has not been featured in any party school rankings by Playboy in recent years or the administration cracking down on partying. Needless to say, nice little town to visit but personally, I don't see myself going here or living here for the next couple years. The location really puts me off of the school. Really nice campus in it's own right I would even say underrated considering the gothic colonial era architecture always get the hype as the most beautiful campus but come on! appreciate modern architecture for once! but the location and the vibe and the social scene that results from the location, it's not for me.

gsppsx,"CASTING CALL: Dramatic Short Film. To be filmed in Pullman this summer. Actresses needed. If you act or know someone who does, PLEASE refer them to this post or contact me. NOT PORN! Much appreciated. Have a great day! (See post for more info.)","Hello, Pullman and WSU!

My name is Nick, and I am a 21-year-old budding filmmaker. I have lived in Pullman for about a year now, and have just finished working on most of the script and pre-production for a dramatic short film. 

I am in need of two twenty-something-year-old actresses for a relatively emotional role. NOT PORN. Many ""casting-calls"" looking for 20-year-old actresses make this post sound like it is also an ad for a porn shoot. It is not. I cannot stress enough that this is a genuine, dramatic short film to be filmed in Pullman this summer. The leads are college-age.

Now, on to the film. It will be titled ""Collision"". It is centered around two students, Amelia and Lois, who live together in an apartment in a small town. Amelia has a father who works as an astronaut, currently serving on the International Space Station. The Earth has fallen out of its orbit, and is on a collision course with our Sun. As a result, society collapses, and the world grows hotter and hotter day by day. The story depicts Amelia and Lois dealing with the social fallout of this catastrophe, as well as a race against the clock. For the rest of the story, you'll have to wait until the film is completed. I will post a finished version on this sub a few months from now when it is completed. 

As I said, these roles will be relatively emotional as the characters are tested throughout the film. Actresses must be able to portray an emotional side, and be willing to work in the heat. It will be filmed in the middle of summer, but all necessary medical precautions will be taken. An enormous aspect of this plot is how unbearably hot it is outside. As for compensation, it will not be too much, as I am just a student-age filmmaker, with my own bills to pay, though ideally actresses will be devoted to the craft as well. I do however recognize that everyone's time is valuable and will do my best to pay fairly. 

I am not plugged into the filmmaking community in Pullman at all, so any other filmmakers, actors, or actresses that are looking for new people to collaborate with, and looking for new projects to work on would be greatly appreciated, either you or someone you know who enjoys filmmaking/performing! The virus happened right as I was gearing up to go into the WSU Film School building, and I won't be able to establish any connections there. So, any information would be greatly appreciated!

To reiterate, if you are interested in the script, shoot me a PM, or please refer me to your friend who enjoys filmmaking/acting. I can send you/them the script. I think with the right people we could have something halfway decent on our hands. Thank you so much for your time! I look forward to hearing from you guys. Have a wonderful day. Stay safe out there!

Courses still will mostly be online, with exceptions as specific educational situations dictate (art courses, science labs, instructors with health risks, etc.).

Also, even for instruction that might be cleared for in-person activity, those will be converted to online at Thanksgiving break, so no students go home and return to campus.

Stay tuned; this makes the most sense, on all fronts, however.

gxg6hh,Temporary Changes Considered For Main Street In Downtown Pullman," Via Pullman Radio News: 

&gt;Temporary changes might be coming to Main Street in downtown Pullman this Summer to test concepts to encourage visitors.  Pullman City Council will consider the idea during its meeting Tuesday night.  
&gt;  
&gt;The proposal is from the recently completed downtown master plan that was funded by the city.  A consultant examined ideas for reinvigorating Pullman’s central business district.  
&gt;  
&gt;One idea is to change the traffic pattern downtown to encourage visitors.  Council is being asked to approve a plan to test the concept.  It would reduce traffic on Main Street between Paradise Street and Grand Avenue from 3 lanes to 2 and add back-in angled parking on the South side of the street.  A protected bike lane would also be added to Main.  
&gt;  
&gt;The concept also includes the idea of what’s called a parklet.  Parklets or streateries utilize a portion of the street in front of a business for customer seating.  The plan to city council will construct at least one parklet.  
&gt;  
&gt;If approved the demonstration project to test the viability of traffic revisions and parklets on Main Street in downtown Pullman would be conducted this Summer.  The trial would end this Fall after students return to class at Washington State University.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/gxg6hh/temporary_changes_considered_for_main_street_in/,Ala_Tipster,1,2020-06-05 20:00:44,1,/r/wsu/comments/gxg6hh/temporary_changes_considered_for_main_street_in/

h9qsml,Palouse Empire Fair cancelled,"via Pullman Radio News

 

&gt;The Whitman County Commissioners have reluctantly canceled this Summer’s annual Palouse Empire Fair.  
&gt;  
&gt;The commissioners voted unanimously to cancel the September fair during their meeting on Monday.  The board asked the fair board to try to craft a plan to operate a fair under the phase 3 restrictions currently imposed on Whitman County by Washington Governor Jay Inslee.  Officials expect the county would still be under the current pandemic order in September which bans gatherings over 50 people.  The fair board was unable to come up with a workable plan for a fair with the expected crowd restriction.  The board recommended to the commissioners that they cancel this year's fair.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can listen to Commissioner Chairman Michael Largent’s comment by clicking on the link below.  
&gt;  
&gt;The annual Palouse Empire Fair normally runs during the second week of September at the fairgrounds West of Colfax.

hgcrqo,Reduced Capacity for Freshman Housing,"The June 24 WSU Insider article about Fall semester states that ""WSU residence halls will have reduced capacity, with most rooms having just a single occupant "". 

I would assume that this means that there will not be enough dorm capacity for all admitted freshmen, perhaps as much as half of the admitted freshman class (single vs double occupancy)

How will this play out for freshman who are not offered housing?

A) On campus residency requirement is waived, but freshmen are required to be present in Pullman. Freshman scramble to find non-dorm housing in Pullman or take gap years.

B) Freshmen are allowed to take on-line courses where ever they choose through WSU (not WSU Global Campus). These would be the same 50+ lectures that can only be delivered on line.

hi0sz7,WSU raises tuition by 2.5% (roughly $250),"Via Pullman Radio News


Tuition is going up again at Washington State University.

The board of regents agreed with the administration for the 4th straight year to raise tuition to the maximum amount allowed by state law.  The regents on Friday unanimously approved a 2.5% tuition increase for the upcoming academic year.  It increases in-state resident undergraduate tuition by about 250 dollars for the year to a total of around 10,200 dollars.  The maximum tuition hike is tied to the growth rate of the median hourly wage in Washington.

The hike is expected to increase WSU revenue by about 5 million dollars for the next fiscal year.  The administration says that will help the institution deal with a roughly 37 million dollar budget shortfall in fiscal year 2021.  The deficit has been caused by lost revenues from the governor’s coronavirus shutdown.

The regents on Friday also approved the 2021 Cougar Athletics budget which is expected to have a roughly 6 million dollar deficit.  That’s down from an expected nearly 17 million dollar deficit in the current fiscal year which ends on Wednesday.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/hi0sz7/wsu_raises_tuition_by_25_roughly_250/,Ala_Tipster,1,2020-06-29 10:26:04,10,/r/wsu/comments/hi0sz7/wsu_raises_tuition_by_25_roughly_250/

hkopti,"WSU's Scummy, Unethical Addendum","**If you will be attending WSU in the fall, this is an important read regarding the latest housing situation.**

Many of you may have received an email this past week regarding the new housing situations this upcoming Fall/Spring of 2020-2021. For those that may have missed it;

*""We will not issue any housing refunds if students must unexpectedly vacate university housing due to changes in university operations resulting from COVID-19 in the 2020-2021 school year.""*

Essentially, for any reason related to COVID-19, WSU can kick you out of your housing for the 2020-2021 school year, and charge you for the entirety of the year with no refunds whatsoever.

Considering approximately 20,000 students will be heading up to Pullman this fall, there is a great chance that an outbreak will occur. If so, few-to-all buildings will need evacuated, as Pullman only has 25 hospital beds.

**If there is an outbreak the first week and classes are online for the rest of the 2020-2021 school year, NOBODY will be receiving a refund after being removed from their housing, and NOBODY will receive a refund on their meal plan, even if the campus completely shuts down and all further classes become remote.**

There are absolutely no refunds on housing and meal plans, even if the school forcibly removes you from the campus due to COVID-19.

The addendum that we all received in our emails is looking to screw us over like no other ""contract"" I've seen before. Not only will students not receive a refund in such a plausible scenario, but students will have to find alternate food and housing, while continuously paying Washington State University for the time spent removed from initial housing and meal plans.

Both of my parents are WSU alumni, and various family members have done tremendous work as WSU professors and researchers. WSU was not my first choice for a university, but I decided to give it a shot. Being an incoming freshman, it hurts me seeing that the school is prioritizing its income over the financial lives of their students. Low-income students will have a very challenging time finishing their degrees if an outbreak is to occur with the new addendum, and each and every one of us could be out tens of thousands of dollars, and the school would be making this money though services not being provided.

Look at your financial plan. [Is this something you'd be willing to lose?](https://livingat.wsu.edu/estimator/reshall.aspx) Should the school be charging you this if they require you leave your housing?

Down below are multiple contacts to get in-touch with WSU representatives, a link to the contract, along with a [change.org](https://www.change.org/p/unethical-housing-addendum-washington-state-university-2020-2021?source_location=topic_page) petition from the lovely u/newcougburner. I highly suggest we all reach out and work to dispute the new addendum as it could seriously put the finances and education of all of us off track. I have been 100% set on going here for the past year, and am just now seriously reconsidering alternatives, whether that be attending a local CC or taking a gap year.

I was excited to get my housing assignment this week, but we are all now in the position of either signing this document or attending another school (UW is offering compensation in the event of a campus closure).

hli8mk,A COVID-19 outbreak on UW’s Greek Row hints at how hard it may be to open colleges this fall...,"[July 3 - Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/a-covid-19-outbreak-on-uws-greek-row-hints-at-how-hard-it-may-be-to-open-colleges-this-fall/)

&gt;As of Friday, 117 students living in 15 fraternity houses this summer have reported testing positive for the virus. The university has confirmed 89 of those cases, along with an additional four students who visited fraternities but didn’t live in them. The numbers are likely to tick upward, since about 1,000 have been tested, including other students who visited the fraternities but didn’t live there.

&gt; Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer with Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County, called the outbreak “very concerning” and said he is worried young adults will spread the disease to more vulnerable populations.

&gt;...

&gt;Other universities are also struggling with how to relay the right message to their students. **Washington State University**, which is on the semester system and will be one of the earliest universities in the state to begin fall term classes on Aug. 24, warned students this week that they must follow health guidelines when they come back to campus. Students who don’t “should consider other arrangements for your education in the fall,” the message said.

July 3rd news so I imagine many will already be aware of the situation there, and while 'most of the students are asymptomatic' I can't imagine the same situation with students interacting with the local community in a town the size of Pullman. We could go from 38 confirmed cases in Whitman County (so far) to having a serious problem. As it stands there's every reason to believe cases locally will sky rocket, and many residents will not be asymptomatic. I understand there is a plan going forward, I assume it will be to just wait until there's a certain number of cases, then move all classes online again. If I were a betting person who doesn't believe this is just going to go away by this fall, I imagine this is what will inevitably happen anyway.

&gt;WSU continue to work with local health authorities as well as city and county governments as the university make plans for emerging from the COVID‑19 environment. On the WSU Pullman campus, for example, officials are in the process of working with the local communities and private residential complexes on a common set of protocols to minimize the chance of a widespread outbreak of the virus.

Are we just deluding ourselves that somehow, and with the right ""plan"" this is going to work, or committed to making it work no matter what?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/hli8mk/a_covid19_outbreak_on_uws_greek_row_hints_at_how/,FriesWithThat,1,2020-07-05 02:49:10,0,/r/wsu/comments/hli8mk/a_covid19_outbreak_on_uws_greek_row_hints_at_how/

If you can help, I would be much appreciated for any and all advice. And if you are interested in taking over the lease, please message me or email me at [christopher.winrich@wsu.edu](mailto:christopher.winrich@wsu.edu). 

From what I have seen, the apartments look nice and the staff are really friendly, the only reason I need to do this takeover is because Pullman is now my and my mother's permanent residence and we need to move out of our current place by July 30th and we can't move into the Grove until August 18th. 

The lease we have is for a 3 bedroom apartment, with the lease being 2 bedroom units of said apartment. Below is the Grove's official page so that you can look into it if you wanted to. Thanks for reading and I hope you stay healthy and safe during these trying times.

hr80p8,Recommended DTC degree Non-DTC Upper-Division Courses or Minor?,"Hi all,

I am a transfer student going into the DTC program this fall at the Vancouver campus. I am hoping to become a UX/UI designer (favoring UX) when I complete this degree. Many required courses are filled to capacity with around a 5 person waitlist. For example, I am 6th on the waitlist for DTC 355 Multimedia Authoring and was thinking I could complete a ""Core Two Course"" instead that needs to be a non-DTC upper-division course. What would you recommend for this? 

Alternatively, I am open to adding a minor on to my degree should it be a good time/money investment. Any suggestions on either some non-DTC upper-division courses that go well with DTC/UX/UI or a 
minor to consider?

Thanks so much,

hr82mo,Going global? ISC but anyone is welcome.,"Hey all, I’m a student at WSU Everett but I’ve recently been considering switching to the global version of my major. Integrated Strategic Communications.  I’m a senior.

To those have switched, how was the process? 

What have been your major challenges with the switch? 

What are some of the good things aside from flexibility? 

Is Zoom/video conferencing much of thing? When our classes switched online I found that Zoom was something that I both loved and hated. 

Do you still feel connected to the university/other students? 

Are there still similar opportunities as the ones that exist at physical campuses?

Is the process different for internships?

Are proctored exams more of a thing in Global? I did it for one class and hated it. It was the worst experience I’ve ever had as a student.

htvhim,[Controversial] but here’s what I think,"LETS BE REAL FOR A MOMENT

There is 100% going to be another spike in cases and is gonna scare everyone so we are going to go back online, not just in pullman but on every university campus...

but here’s what I think.

I think instead of living in fear of the virus, we should learn how to live with it until x happens. Vaccine, cure, what makes you feel comfortable..

What I mean by living with it is what nobody is talking about and that is taking care of your immune system. Working out &amp; staying in shape, eat your vitamin A, C, D, and Zinc.

Not to get political, but a certain extent of civil liberties you give up to the government by having shelter in place orders. People gave them up this round to feel ‘safe’ for something that turned out not to be that fatal as we once thought.

I’m not against the idea of shelter in place but this wasn’t an airborne Ebola or anything. even if ASSUMING the data is 100% accurate this was a little worse than a BAD flu year. I know that’s gonna be controversial....

But my main point being that if you are a healthy human being or even immune compromised, you should have the right to do as you please with your life and shouldn’t be restricted by the government telling you what to do..

The problem then rises is that “yeah sure i’ll be fine, but i don’t want to kill my grandma” and for that is 100%  understandable cause i know i don’t. But the answer would go back to what I said previously that being your right to choose what want to do. and in that case it would be to isolate yourself, and let everyone else choose what they want to do. 

You have to understand that the elderly are susceptible &amp; may die to a lot of other normal illnesses that you may cary &amp; not just covid..

I just want to go back and have a normal semester, have social events, in class lectures, parties, etc... but i know i’ll get shamed if i say that.. just my opinion 🤷‍♂️

huol2t,"Tricky deadline to avoid housing cancellation fee, Aug 3rd.","For those of you wanting to take all online classes from home you won't be able to confirm which classes are online until Aug. 1, and must process your university housing cancellation by Aug. 3 to avoid cancellation fees.

This means you will have to make a decision quickly or try to find new online options with a very small window to receive feedback from advisors or student support staff.

If you are a freshman you can have the freshman live in rule waived due to covid-19 by going to this link and explaining your situation: https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?WashingtonStateUniv&amp;layout_id=41 

For freshman you would need to confirm your classes are all online on the 1st, or find new ones, then submit the form above as soon as possible to increase the chance it will be processed before the 3rd.  You can cancel your housing contract once you receive approval to have the live-in rule waived. 

It's an extremely small window to avoid that cost.

My prediction is that many students will find solutions and be able to go entirely online all the way up to the first week of classes but that almost all of them with university housing will pay cancellation or termination fees.

You can see those fees here:

i1hzyx,How my lease was broken,"This will mainly help people that rented a home.

We all know that the rental agencies here aren't the best, and that more then one is willing to cut corners to save money because Pullman and Moscow do not regulate pretty much anything when it comes to the rental industry.

I rented a home with Apartment Rentals Inc that I thought was kinda sketchy, but like any broke student I took what I could get. On a whim I pulled the latest City Inspection ( you can order it for free because they are public record ) which was 20 years old, so I payed for a new inspection and discovered that 2 of the 4 bedrooms still did not meet minimum safety standards reported from the original city inspector. 

Because the home had been falsely advertised (Apartment Rentals Inc did this intentionally, but unintentionally works too), the lease agreement was never valid and I was able to leave the home.

Please check out what qualifies as minimum safety standards on the link below, and I hope this helps someone out.

“Friends,

I have been considering a career change for some time, and now with all that is happening in the world I have decided it is time to move on to something new. I feel so fortunate that over the last 10+ years I was able to be a member of Pullman's downtown community. I heard and was a part of so many different stories, and I look forward to future stories. It’s crazy to look back on my time at Cafe Moro and think about the journey: the fear of buying a business, the growing pains of being an employer, the incredible people I have been lucky enough to work with, and the community members that became so much more than customers. 

Cafe Moro is closing its doors on August 20th. Thank you to everyone who made Moro their home and supported us, and a special thanks to all of the people who worked so hard behind the counter to make Moro such a unique community.

I hope I get the chance to see as many of you as possible in the next few weeks. If you can’t make it in, our facebook page will stay up for the next few months so feel free to reach out.

ibwpm7,Question about WUE at WSU-Vancouver,"I transferred in last spring, and received the WUE scholarship for $11000. This year it looks like I was only awarded $5000 a semester instead of $5500, and I can’t get an answer from financial aid on why that is. My GPA went up last semester, and my need is the same. Wondering if anyone else is having the same issue? Or if WSU lowered the award amount?

iczdkh,Some advice for incoming Freshman during a particularly tricky year,"I made a [similar post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/ch0nhp/advice_for_incoming_business_students/) last year offering advice to incoming Freshman. Obviously this will be a weird year and a lot has changed. This advice is probably best geared towards freshman business students, with that said, a lot is applicable too many majors. I’m several years removed from WSU, but am an active alumni and have gained an awful lot of experience working virtually the past half year. 

One thing that is true from a WSU degree and has been for years. is that nothing is guaranteed from going to WSU, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make anything from a WSU degree. It’s a school where you get out what you put in, I know a lot of people who went on to work for companies like Microsoft, Amazon, KPMG, Boeing as well as a lot of people who got great positions at smaller companies. 4 years later, these people are being promoted and finding a ton of success. I also knew a lot of people who didn’t take things seriously, struggled to find work and especially struggled to find work in their field. There are a lot of companies that want to hire Cougs, but they want to make sure they are getting a hard worker and someone who will be good for them. 

1. Try to connect with professors. If they host virtual office hours, try to talk with them and get to know them. They have industry connections, letters of recommendation mean a lot from them and are oftentimes interesting people. I’ve stayed close with several of my professors and that helped me make a big career jump from a bigger company to a smaller one. Professors like to know their students, assuming an eventual return to campus, I’m sure a lot will value students who went out of their way to get to know them during the pandemic. 


2. If you’re having a problem, be vocal about it. The saying goes, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Most professors are going to assume things are going well until they hear otherwise. If you’re having trouble with an assignment, confused about something, or anything, reach out to them. It will help you and other students. 

3. Try to get involved. If clubs are operating virtually, look into joining one this semester. The commitment will probably be lesser and you may be able to get more resources out of it. If you’re new to freshman business major taking classes from home, your parents won’t be much help, advisors are limited so try looking into joining a business club. Students who know what to do will be a great resource. I was heavily involved in Alpha Kappa Psi throughout my 4 years at WSU, it helped me get a job with Microsoft after college and is full of hard working students who can help you through these tough times. 

4. Don’t take the year off. It will absolutely be possible to go through the year with very little effort, pass/fail classes and won’t impact you too much. If you’re a graduating senior, that’s one thing, but if you’re a freshman, don’t do it. You’re going to want to build good study habits when you’re taking freshman classes so when you do go to campus and are taking harder classes, it won’t be that much of a culture shock. 


Best of luck to all students, if you have any questions, please feel free to message me. It’s a tough year, you got this!

ikpeby,COVID-19 TIPS / coug health did nothing to help me,"I’m a sophomore now, but last spring semester, I came down with a TERRIBLE sickness around February. I had a horrible fever, sore throat, chills, the worst of it was that I couldn’t smell or taste anything for weeks. After 2 days of a fever (100.3F) I scheduled an appointment (negative) for coug health. They checked me for strep and told me continue going to classes as normal. They told me I was overreacting even when I tried to tell them I have never had an illness like what I was experiencing. When I got home for spring break (when I was better) we found out via UW Medical (antibodies testing) that I actually was infected with COVID-19. 

IF YOU HAVE IT HERE ARE MY TIPS (if you THINK you have it, get tested)

- Drink Gatorade, use ibeprofun regularly to take down your fever. 

- SLEEP, like any sickness you need sleep. 

- STAY ISOLATED, when I was in Pullman I stayed isolated to one room when possible, stay away from others (Greek row, grow up and stop spreading the virus)

- EAT, I forgot to eat, I lost 3 pounds when infected because I was so depressed about not being able to taste anything. Even if it’s saltine crackers please eat

That’s all I really got, I know it’s not much, but with Pullman being top 5 in nation for quickest spread relative to population, I want you guys to stay safe, and say aware.

I already took a gap year last year, so this is the start of my second year after high school being at home. I was already jealous of my friends who went to college straight out of high school, that they got that experience and I haven't had it yet. This just fucking sucks. I know it might sound dramatic and selfish, but I just feel betrayed and like my youth has been ripped away from me.

iozarr,Emergency Declared For Whitman County - Fires Mostly Under Control - Relief Efforts Being Coordinated," Via Pullman Radio News

&gt;An emergency declaration is now in place for Whitman County because of Monday’s firestorm.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Whitman County Commissioners unanimously approved the declaration this morning.  Commissioner Chairman Michael Largent explains what that means.  You can listen to Largent’s comments by clicking on the link below.  
&gt;  
&gt;Monday’s firestorm destroyed most of Malden and burned about half the structures in Pine City.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another fire burned about a thousand acres Northwest of Colfax in the Palouse River Canyon.  The commissioners report that both fires are mostly under control this morning after speaking to local volunteer fire chiefs in the field.  
&gt;  
&gt;Chairman Largent says one of their priorities today will be to coordinate relief efforts to help firestorm victims.  They estimate up to 85 homes were destroyed on Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;The commissioners will be touring the devastation this afternoon.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are in the area and can help, please reach out to local authorities to find ways you can help the relief efforts.

it1cas,IT people of WSU- how much of a risk is the K-29 network?,"Hello everyone!

So I know WSU essentially has its own internet system through utilizing the K-20 network, but I am unsure how exactly this process works and what risks it poses in terms of security?

For example, is it the k-20 system that addresses all of our DNS requests or does WSU have their own servers? 

WSU has very clear guidelines for retention of logs, internet activity, etc. that I feel are pretty good about keeping all the users safe (keeping for a period of time to prevent fraud/abuse but not so much so that it risks a data leak due to how long they retain it). I’m curious if this is all data that WSU specifically has access to only (e.g., all of the logs of internet activity, dns logs, etc.) or if the K-20 network has its own logs that include this information.

Basically, does the company that operates the k-20 network have all the logs and activity of all users or is this stuff that is all kept in house at Wsu specifically? Not sure if that makes sense, let me know if it doesn’t! 

If the k-20 company that runs the network does have access to all of the data and has its own logs of all the user internet browsing activity, what type of retention would they have for things like activity logs, security logs, sysadmin logs, etc.? 

I think in many ways I trust Wsu with a lot of all of this, as I know our network IT team has really good training, resources, etc. but when I think about some random company that runs the k-20  network I feel less sure about the security and am more curious about their retention guidelines as well as what actual data they can see?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/it1cas/it_people_of_wsu_how_much_of_a_risk_is_the_k29/,TheBobGuy57,1,2020-09-15 00:03:52,9,/r/wsu/comments/it1cas/it_people_of_wsu_how_much_of_a_risk_is_the_k29/

WSU needs to add a button that does all that for you if they aren't going to try an stop this.

iy0q8p,Certify in Major with low cumulative G.P.A,"Hello everyone!

I am first generation college student from a low-income family, hoping to graduate with a degree in Strategic Communications. Sadly my current cumulative GPA is 2.56 and 2.7 cumulative GPA Is required to certify. What is the certifying process like? And can I appeal the decision if denied?

To make a very long story short, my parent’s business that is attached to their house caught on fire in November of Fall 2014 semester (Sophomore year). My parents decided to separate soon after and did not tell me because I was already overwhelmed with the fire incident while attending school. I did not find out about their separation till towards the end of Spring 2015 semester (April) since I assist them with filing taxes (First-generation problems). I was put on academic probation and spent about 1.5 years to be with family since I knew it was going to be the last times we will be together. 

Fast forward to 2017 and I am a student at WSU again!!! Yay! Towards the end of Fall 2017 semester, my elderly father was diagnosed with kidney cancer around November. This took an emotional and time consuming toll as I had to drive from Pullman to Yakima Valley and then to Tacoma for evaluations, surgeries, and future checkups. I talked to the Dean of Students but they advised it is too late to appeal my Sophomore grades (2 years to appeal) and would be best to retake those classes. Which is exactly what I did. 

It is now 2020!!! I managed to retake many classes once or twice due too so many unfortunate events that happened while taking or retaking classes. I have a 2.56 GPA and a 2.7 is required to certify. I feel as though I have beat all statistics considering I am a from a low income family in a urban area that had a 60% graduation rate along with being a first generation college student going through hell. So hopefully there is an appeal process for those going through these situations and wanting to certify with a low GPA.... cause I am running out of money and time 😅

The NCEES, the body that regulates engineering licensure (Also known as the organization that actually matters), allows for HUNDREDS of pages of reference material. It was recently converted to a searchable PDF. And you're telling me that I have to pass your tests with no reference material? What do you think would happen in industry if I submitted calculations without citing where I obtained them? Oh yeah, I wouldn't be in industry.

If the governing body that controls your discipline has managed to pull their heads out for long enough to make an attempt at bringing the content up to within at least 15 years of modern, why is it so hard for curriculum to do the same?

I'm finna make this daily drama because I work in Industry and I'm getting real tired of the disparity. I'm also pissed that the NCEES converted the reference manual because my dumb ass has been studying all my classes out of the old paper version because a bunch of old ass engineers told me the hardest part of the test was figuring out where shit was in the book.

I'm planning to add more features this semester, too: instructor pages, course reviews, etc, so stay tuned for that!

This actually took quite a bit of work to make though so if you if you like it then please do consider sending it to your friends.

Oh yeah and a few course pages are broken right now like Math 100 but I'll fix that soon - let me know if there are any other bugs or features you'd like to see.

j7pq13,Transfer for Summer or for Fall 2021 - Asking for recommendation or help,"Hi everyone-

First off Go Cougs :) 

I have a question about transferring in and definitely looking for some recommendations from those that have transferred in with some college credit. 

So back story- when I was a freshman/sophomore in college I did .... meh - okay, in classes. After my freshman year I had a 2.9 but after my sophomore year I had a 1.8. Just went thru a bad depression sophomore year but anyway - that is far behind me. 

Fast forward to a better place in my life (with more life experience and job experience), I have been taking classes (and getting all As) at my local community college and have raised my GPA slightly (those of you who have experienced this know how hard it can be to raise a GPA) and I am looking to transfer in to WSU. It’s been my goal to graduate from there. 

I was wondering if anyone knew how strict they were for transfer students under a 2.5? I know I can prove that my grades from 2012/2013 are a thing of the past as I am getting all As and working really hard and taking as many classes as I can. I am really trying to get all of my comparable UCORE classes and some classes that go towards my major completed for success. 

With that said- I have plans to continue with my community college classes in January (expedited 8 week classes) so I’m wondering do you think I could get in or should try to get in for summer with a GPA of a 2.2 (deadline is April 14) or should I continue taking more and more classes until the July deadline for fall (July 23) and keep trying to completely raise my GPA above a 2.5?

Thanks for any input. I am meeting with an academic advisor and building that relationship but I wanted to get others opinions who possibly have been in this situation.  Thank you all so much!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/j7pq13/transfer_for_summer_or_for_fall_2021_asking_for/,yogadogdadtx21,1,2020-10-08 21:11:49,2,/r/wsu/comments/j7pq13/transfer_for_summer_or_for_fall_2021_asking_for/
j8849k,(rant) Seriously why is WSU so bad at listening to its students?,"This spring break thing is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the school making decisions that affect students without any consideration.

First they proposed a tuition hike. Not only is tuition high enough, especially for non-instate students, but they proposed this during a pandemic, where layoffs were occurring in droves, causing financial issues for students and their families. The feedback from students and families was a clear and  resounding 'No, at least not now'.  WSU raised tuition anyways, despite the pushback.

Then there is ProctorU. WSU says it wants to use it on tests; students are against the idea and voice valid concerns about privacy, accessibility, and security. WSU gives a generic response, and then says its going to use ProctorU. 

There are so many examples, and each time WSU overrides the wishes of students(notable exception was housing agreement) . In comparison udub dropped the idea of ProctorU after pushback. 

While its too soon to tell how WSU will respond to the outcry that is likely occurring in response to the Spring break 2021 plan, their track record is not encouraging. Its infuriating how tone deaf WSU is in matters like this.

j8axn9,A Class of Mine is Failing. Need Advice.,"Without being too specific, a calculus based science class I'm in is 100% failing. Not necessarily the students in the class, but the class itself.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is mainly centered around testing. The first test we had was last week (Friday 10/2). There were 5 questions, all of which were either multiple choice or fill in the blank. From what I can remember, the first question was a problem that took roughly 20mins of math and only a fill in the blank answer was accepted. Another was a concept check where we checked all the statements that were true. The last one that I can remember was almost exactly the same as a problem that was on the homework due the following Monday, took roughly 20mins of math, and you selected a answer from 5 answers. There was no problem that looked like it in previous homework. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what's bothering me the most. We couldn't show our work for anything. Literally for every question (even the select all that are true problem) no matter what mistake someone made, they lost 20%. Every other class I'm in allowed us to take pictures of our work and have it graded, or some other method for students to show their work/explain their reasoning. According to the professor, there ""aren't enough TA's to grade pictures of students' work."" 

&amp;#x200B;

After the first test, daily class attendance floats around 60-80 students (absolute maximum has been 80). Supposedly 180 students took the test.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what questions I got wrong on the test, I just received a score.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, this is pathetic and unacceptable. I need advice on how to proceed. Should I go to administration or will they just gaslight me and try to sweep it under the rug? If I should then who should I talk to? Is this even legal? The professor didn't even know how testing was going to be done until a week before the exam. In my opinion, the only option for the school at this point is to switch it to pass fail. If a student who drops a sign and someone who doesn't know how to even start a problem get the same grade then what other option is there?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/j8axn9/a_class_of_mine_is_failing_need_advice/,jjim02598,1,2020-10-09 20:37:53,2,/r/wsu/comments/j8axn9/a_class_of_mine_is_failing_need_advice/

Most students have such a hard time coding on Mac that they have to use Bootcamp to run Windows 10 on the Mac, defeating the purpose of getting a Mac in the first place.

janum2,"I fucking love Pullman and Wazzu, and the current situation is breaking my heart","Pullman has always been an amazing place to be, especially as a young person going through the experience of college. For most of us, WSU was like we had always dreamed of when we thought of going away to college. For many of us, it was far better than we had dreamed. It's a beautiful and magical place to spend your 4-ish years and the community there was more like a family than my own blood family. 

So it hurts me deeply to see Pullman making headlines for being one of the worst hot spots for the worst pandemic in recent history. A failure at a national and local level to handle the coronavirus properly has resulted in thousands of students - most poignantly new freshman and (even more sadly) graduating seniors - having at least an entire year of WSU time taken away, ruined, and soured. Businesses shutting down and Martin Stadium sitting empty. No one laying on the grassy hills at night looking up at stars with their friends, or gathering in the CUB for some lunch and studying and laughing, carefree and excited for the rest of the year. My heart aches so horribly for all the Cougs who have had their year taken from them. And that is to say nothing of the division being sown in this country that is also affecting the Wazzu family. I've seen it on the Facebook pages. Cougs intentionally antagonizing each other over politics like a bunch of assholes. It's disappointing and saddening. We're supposed to be better than this. We were supposed to get through this together. Those of us whose hearts are still in Pullman, and those whose entire bodies are there (lol). 

I have no doubt that we'll get through this eventually, and the sun will rise on WSU again. I just wish it didn't cost so much. I know someone whose daughter was going to start at WSU this year, and he asked if I think he should advise her to wait another year at home before going. I told him yes without hesitation. I don't want her (or anyone's) first impression of WSU to be *this*. This isn't Wazzu. This isn't us. She, and all of the excited new students, deserve better than this. I just hope that next Fall is that better. 

And I'm keeping the usage of 'Wazzu'. I don't care what some committee says, there's nothing negative implied by the use of the term. It's part of the great heritage of this school and it's community.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/janum2/i_fucking_love_pullman_and_wazzu_and_the_current/,The_Drunker_Coug,1,2020-10-13 18:18:22,27,/r/wsu/comments/janum2/i_fucking_love_pullman_and_wazzu_and_the_current/

jcswug,Idea: make students provide a negative COVID test result from the past 3 days before they can use any of the on campus gyms,"This would be an effective way of forcing students living on or around campus to take covid tests. The gym is the only place where its possible for a responsible person to come into contact with an party goer or an infected individual for an extended period of time.

Also there is a tendency in frats and sororities for the members to go to the gym and work out together, so this would effectively force them to be tested on a weekly basis. This is beneficial to them as well, as they  can have some way of knowing who has been exposed. And it prevents infected individuals from exposing themselves to large groups of people. 

Obviously, the school would have to make testing free and accessible to the students who want them. And the results should be available at most with in 24 hours. If it took longer then the every 3 day part would have to be lengthened.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/jcswug/idea_make_students_provide_a_negative_covid_test/,Snazzy21,1,2020-10-17 06:36:16,13,/r/wsu/comments/jcswug/idea_make_students_provide_a_negative_covid_test/

jj4tfq,September’s Wawawai Canyon Fire West Of Pullman Likely Intentionally Set,"Via Pullman Radio News:


The Whitman County Sheriff’s office believes that last month’s blaze that torched Wawawai Canyon was likely intentionally set.

Deputies and the City of Pullman’s fire investigator found evidence where the fire ignited that supports their belief that someone started the blaze on purpose.

The fire broke out shortly after midnight on Saturday, September 12th in a remote location on Boone Hill Road West of Pullman.  The blaze torched about 300 acres in the canyon near the Snake River.

Whitman County Fire District 12 Volunteers out of Pullman fought the flames with help from Volunteers from District 14 out of Colton-Uniontown, District 4 from Palouse, and District 11 from Colfax and Albion.  Volunteers had the fire mostly under control Saturday morning.  The blaze was state mobilized bringing firefighters from around Washington to mop up the flames.  No structures were damaged, and no one was hurt.

The area has seen a rash of suspicious fires in recent years.  Volunteers responded to 10 suspicious blazes in Southern Whitman County near the Snake River in 2018 and one last year.  The sheriff’s office is looking into any possible connections between the September canyon fire and previous suspicious blazes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/jj4tfq/septembers_wawawai_canyon_fire_west_of_pullman/,Ala_Tipster,1,2020-10-27 12:49:21,1,/r/wsu/comments/jj4tfq/septembers_wawawai_canyon_fire_west_of_pullman/

jkcz2p,Many businesses on the brink of closure in Pullman on the brink of closure in the next 6-10 weeks.,"From The Morning News Podcast in Pullman:

  
Comments from Pullman Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Marie Dymkoski Thursday, October 29th, 2020:    


&gt;""If you know me you know I'm a very optimistic person and I try really hard to shine light, but this is a serious moment and one that I wanna make sure people really truly try to understand. Things may look OK, you may drive down and see shops open, etc. But, they're not as OK as they may seem. We have many businesses right on the brink of closing and some of those tell us if nothing changes within the next six to ten weeks they will be closing their doors, and it's businesses that you don't want to see close. I mean we don't want to see any close, but some will be your favorite businesses. And I'm talking across the board. I'm talking restaurants, retail, we have some hotels of course that are struggling. It's closer than you think to closure, and we want to be able to support them in the way that they need in the next several months.  
&gt;  
&gt;...I want to reiterate something. First of all the community has done a really great job of supporting, when the need arose this summer, the community did a really great job. But we're seeing a big drop-off and I think, I'm hearing from many businesses that September was the third worst month following March and April of this year. And why is that? Well of course, you know, the influx of visitors were not here in September, but we also had the uptick in the Covid cases. So what we saw were our elderly and the compromised were staying at home. The worst September. If they see that again, those numbers in October, we're gonna see some failed businesses come November and December. And so, what can we do? Many of us step up and we buy a meal from a restaurant once a week. But I'm gonna challenge the community to purchase like they did this time last year. If you went out several times last year, a week, do that again. Buy online, have it delivered, pickup, curbside. Remember too those, this time of year, those events that you went too that were catered. Those restaurants are not catering anymore. We have a couple restaurants that relied very heavily on catering and they're doing zero right now. So, you know, take that into consideration as well. We're coming up on the holiday season. I know it's so fun to go to the cities and do that fun shopping but it's really important that we think about shopping in Pullman first. And I think you'd be surprised if you start looking around at some of the fine gift stores and specialty wines and cheeses and floral arrangements for your tables. Things like that that you can get right in Pullman with no problems whatsoever if you just look, and if you get out of the habit maybe of looking elsewhere and really think strongly about supporting the businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;...Another thing I want to mention about that is that many of the businesses have pivoted during this moment, several of them have really moved to online. Putting their menus online, putting their gifts online, you can go to Flirt and make an appointment to be in there during a time that they're closed to be in there by yourself. Many of the businesses are really, you know, trying to cater to the needs of the community. Buying gift cards is certainly very helpful. And what teenager doesn't want a gift card where they can go buy their own thing, right? Many of the businesses have gift cards as well. So there's ways that they're working to support the community, and we need to show our support for them.  
&gt;  
&gt;...Not only are they adhering to the governor's orders, the restaurants can only be at 50% capacity. So what they were doing in September, October of last year, they can only do 50% of that this year. So it is really important for us to support that. They're all doing a great job of maintaining the safe distancing, the mask wearing, the cleaning protocols, and all of those things. So there really is a small chance that there's gonna be a problem for you. But if you are elderly, and you are compromised, they want to cater to you by doing a pickup or delivery. They're doing a great job. They're working for us, we need to do that for them.  
&gt;  
&gt;We can't have it both ways, it's very difficult to balance that and so we have to step up and really support...can I just take this moment to reiterate, and I know people know this at a certain level. City is going through their budget communications for the next couple of years, and sales tax dollars from our businesses is a huge part of their budget. Those things support services like police and fire, our library, parks and recreations. And so when we have much smaller sales tax dollars to work with it really cuts into those services. I want to reiterated, and I'm not suggesting that we do purchase online. But if there is something that you have to have that you cannot find in Pullman. Be sure to have it shipped to your zip code, because you will get part of that sales tax. If you take it outside of Pullman than we lose that opportunity.  
&gt;  
&gt;We really are on the brink of losing many of our businesses. This isn't a tattle-tale, this is the truth. A portion of our retail sector, our hospitality sector, many of our non-profit organizations that couldn't have their fundraisers. So how can you support them? You can buy gift cards, you can order takeout as much as you did last year at this time, remembering that they've lost their catering. And if you went to parties this time of year, football tailgates and you had it catered, remember those things aren't happening. And then, last, wear a mask when you're out and physically distance and wash your hands, and let's get rid of this thing.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/jkcz2p/many_businesses_on_the_brink_of_closure_in/,Ala_Tipster,1,2020-10-29 12:12:35,0,/r/wsu/comments/jkcz2p/many_businesses_on_the_brink_of_closure_in/

...I want to reiterate something. First of all the community has done a really great job of supporting, when the need arose this summer, the community did a really great job. But we're seeing a big drop-off and I think, I'm hearing from many businesses that September was the third worst month following March and April of this year. And why is that? Well of course, you know, the influx of visitors were not here in September, but we also had the uptick in the Covid cases. So what we saw were our elderly and the compromised were staying at home. The worst September. If they see that again, those numbers in October, we're gonna see some failed businesses come November and December. And so, what can we do? Many of us step up and we buy a meal from a restaurant once a week. But I'm gonna challenge the community to purchase like they did this time last year. If you went out several times last year, a week, do that again. Buy online, have it delivered, pickup, curbside. Remember too those, this time of year, those events that you went too that were catered. Those restaurants are not catering anymore. We have a couple restaurants that relied very heavily on catering and they're doing zero right now. So, you know, take that into consideration as well. We're coming up on the holiday season. I know it's so fun to go to the cities and do that fun shopping but it's really important that we think about shopping in Pullman first. And I think you'd be surprised if you start looking around at some of the fine gift stores and specialty wines and cheeses and floral arrangements for your tables. Things like that that you can get right in Pullman with no problems whatsoever if you just look, and if you get out of the habit maybe of looking elsewhere and really think strongly about supporting the businesses.  
...Another thing I want to mention about that is that many of the businesses have pivoted during this moment, several of them have really moved to online. Putting their menus online, putting their gifts online, you can go to Flirt and make an appointment to be in there during a time that they're closed to be in there by yourself. Many of the businesses are really, you know, trying to cater to the needs of the community. Buying gift cards is certainly very helpful. And what teenager doesn't want a gift card where they can go buy their own thing, right? Many of the businesses have gift cards as well. So there's ways that they're working to support the community, and we need to show our support for them.  
...Not only are they adhering to the governor's orders, the restaurants can only be at 50% capacity. So what they were doing in September, October of last year, they can only do 50% of that this year. So it is really important for us to support that. They're all doing a great job of maintaining the safe distancing, the mask wearing, the cleaning protocols, and all of those things. So there really is a small chance that there's gonna be a problem for you. But if you are elderly, and you are compromised, they want to cater to you by doing a pickup or delivery. They're doing a great job. They're working for us, we need to do that for them.  
We can't have it both ways, it's very difficult to balance that and so we have to step up and really support...can I just take this moment to reiterate, and I know people know this at a certain level. City is going through their budget communications for the next couple of years, and sales tax dollars from our businesses is a huge part of their budget. Those things support services like police and fire, our library, parks and recreations. And so when we have much smaller sales tax dollars to work with it really cuts into those services. I want to reiterated, and I'm not suggesting that we do purchase online. But if there is something that you have to have that you cannot find in Pullman. Be sure to have it shipped to your zip code, because you will get part of that sales tax. If you take it outside of Pullman than we lose that opportunity.  
We really are on the brink of losing many of our businesses. This isn't a tattle-tale, this is the truth. A portion of our retail sector, our hospitality sector, many of our non-profit organizations that couldn't have their fundraisers. So how can you support them? You can buy gift cards, you can order takeout as much as you did last year at this time, remembering that they've lost their catering. And if you went to parties this time of year, football tailgates and you had it catered, remember those things aren't happening. And then, last, wear a mask when you're out and physically distance and wash your hands, and let's get rid of this thing.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/jkcztz/many_pullman_businesses_on_the_brink_of_closure/,Ala_Tipster,1,2020-10-29 12:13:45,30,/r/wsu/comments/jkcztz/many_pullman_businesses_on_the_brink_of_closure/

jl5g7t,"Will probably be moving to Pullman for Spring 2021, does The Ruckus or Retreat provide ethernet access?","Hello fellow Cougs!   


I've been told that my AFROTC course will be held in-person next semester so I've been looking at potential housing options in Pullman. I don't know how the dorm situation is, but I've really only been looking at apartments in the area. Two that have shown up a lot are The Ruckus and The Retreat, both of which I'm probably interested in.   


My main question and concern is whether or not they have reliable internet and ethernet connections so I can use a desktop or console. Hopefully someone who has had experience living in one of those apartments can help, as I can only find ""wi-fi available"" under services for both locations. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few things to note;  
\&gt; I'm hoping rent is no more than $650 a month. I would barely be getting by with utilities, food, and potential extra fees added on. I'm also not making more than x3 rent so I am required to have a co-signer for most places.   
\&gt; Since I'm in AFRTOC, I don't want to be too far from campus as I will have PT during the week in the morning, the closer the better.   
\&gt; I plan to work at the Pullman Walmart over the course of the semester (if not longer), so ideally if there was something between campus and Walmart that would be best.   
\&gt; I mostly care about internet access, but having access to a gym or pool would be a huge plus.   


If you have any suggestions or recommendations, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/jl5g7t/will_probably_be_moving_to_pullman_for_spring/,JakeTheMystic,1,2020-10-30 17:17:10,6,/r/wsu/comments/jl5g7t/will_probably_be_moving_to_pullman_for_spring/

Are the services from WSU itself actually any good? Are they always full? (I know us college students are a depressed bunch). Does anyone have recommendations for local people if WSU is lackluster? Does WSU/local people prescribe medication as well? Because I know whatever is wrong with me definitely can't be fixed just by talking it out. How can I find out if someone can prescribe meds without going and wasting a visit/money? Do I just tell them I want medication as well, or is that taboo? Do I have to hope they tell me I need it? 

And more generally, how the heck do I set this up? What do I talk about? Its a scary and embarassing (yeah yeah, stigma) situation and I have no idea wtf to do.

&gt;Pullman Regional Hospital is not at capacity.  A recent headline in the Daily News inaccurately stated this. It is safe to have surgery/care at Pullman Regional Hospital. All services are open and available. Our volumes change every day. The day this article came out, we were at 40 percent capacity. We were frequently at capacity in October but we have not been in November so far. During this challenging time, PRH meets every day to assess patient volumes, acuity level, staffing, PPE, space, equipment, supplies and the regional bed capacity.

Here’s a bit of a backstory,
I currently live at home and I go to a community college. My best friend lives with me because of financial struggles, etc. I have applied to colleges, but i’m concerned about my housing situation? My friend wants to move with me because there isn’t any other options for her. So I have a few questions,

1.Could she live with me in an apartment if she isn’t a student? 

2. Luckily, my parents are paying for my housing. However, if I get a one bedroom apartment, would my friend also have to sign on the lease and pay rent? 

3.When I’m looking for apartment complexes, I notice there is a difference and it says “per unit” vs “per housing” does per unit mean that I could live in a one bedroom apartment with 2 people and it would be the same cost?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/k8sxwk/can_my_friend_live_with_me_in_apartments/,unrequitedangel,1,2020-12-07 19:02:55,9,/r/wsu/comments/k8sxwk/can_my_friend_live_with_me_in_apartments/

I'm a Biochem major planning on going into Pharmaceutical research after I complete my schooling. So I talked to the office of Undergraduate Research about my plans back in Fall 2019. They were talking about how, if I go into research here at WSU I'd be getting a salary and housing. I had meant to ask them more about this later in the Spring semester but didn't get the chance to due to Covid. 

So my question is, for anyone who knows or is in a similar situation, what all goes along with going into research at WSU? 
I will probably ask in person when Covid is dealt with, but seeing how that might not be done with for at least a little while, I wanted to get to know more about this program on my own.

Could jump on WSU Wireless or WSU ResNet Aruba and chat with everyone using the same network. It's that simple. **You can try here:** [http://www.klak.app/wsu](http://www.klak.app/wsu)

**Back story:** I used to be an RA and even though you had a lots of people in a Hall, it could still be a bit difficult for many students to meet and chat with other students if they were not on your floor. Always thought there should be dead simple way to join group chat where you knew for sure it was other people in the hall or the general university population. but also the chat wasn't too public. Either you had access to the network or you didn't.   
So worked on this last fall, but got busy with other work, the whole world wide pandemic, etc. Now after lots of trial and error we wiped everything and started from scratch and now version 2 is here.

I've known for a long time that I've had pretty bad test anxiety, but this really hit hard. Not only that, but it's very obvious that it's test anxiety based on the grades for all other assignments. Not to mention, I've been able to prove to others that my knowledge on the subject has grown exponentially since the first time I failed it. 

The reason I'm making a post here is to ask if anyone knows some options for helping test anxiety and possible access center functions. I used the access center the semester before last but didn't utilize them this semester because I wasn't sure if there was anything they could do due to Covid.

I live 5 hours away from Pullman, and I know that ideally I would just drive out there next year. But, I just know that I won’t be ready for that even if I obtained my license before that day, and I’ve been stressing about my alternative options. Without considering driving out there from my area (Puyallup to Pullman) because I really don’t see that happening by then, should I just take public transport there? Or is there anything else I should plan for? I’m really just looking for an alternative that isn’t too costly and okay for luggage, because I will be taking my stuff, but if it’s costly that’s fine too because it will be temporary until I get comfortable driving that far.

According to a recent [study](https://www.security.org/resources/homeless-statistics/) by safety resource Security.org, Washington has the fifth highest rate of homelessness per 100,000 people.

As the Hearts for the Homeless Pullman President, you will positively impact your community with a great international team supporting your drive to help others and implementing any great ideas you suggest.

kumfv5,Double Major? MIS &amp; HBM???,"Just wondering if anyone has ever double majored in both MIS and HBM for their undergrad? I currently work in the hospitality business and will continue working here while I go through my undergrad program at WSU and was thinking it might be a good idea.

I’m glad I saw it because I, too, have tuition listed as being due tomorrow, the 11th, even though all of my classes start on the 19th. Is this an error on the school’s part? 

My financial aid for the semester has **not** been applied to my account yet, and I was planning on using part of this week to make sure I had all my finances in order.... So my anxiety is through the *roof!*

kuwruf,I hate the Big Bang Theory and my roommate is driving me crazy,"So I have a roommate that watches the Big Bang theory like every day and likes to talk about it.

I hate it I hate it I hate it!!! I loathe The Big Bang Theory with the white-hot fury of 1,000 suns. How many times do I have to say it, BAZINGA IS NOT FUNNY! SHELDON IS NOT FUNNY! HOWARD IS NOT FUNNY! LEONARD IS NOT FUNNY! RAJ IS NOT FUNNY! AND AMY IS ESPECIALLY NOT FUNNY! The Big Bang Theory is simply not funny! It’s not, no matter how many times you include the laugh track it's just NOT FUNNY. And if you’re thinking to yourself, “But it is!”, you’re just wrong. Sorry, but your brain is wired incorrectly. How on earth does this show have more than 10 season and why does it generate a huge fanbase?

And the writing is abysmal. The viewers think they are some sort of geniuses because they understand the basic high school math references and feel as if they're as smart as the physicist. There are also basic science references that make the audience feel soooo smart but they're basic at best such as:

*""I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker.""*

*(CANNED LAUGHTER)*

The formula, for damn near every joke, is as follows. Nerds are so gosh darn nerdy that they can’t act normal in regular life! Wash. Rinse. Repeat. For example, here’s a bit of gut-busting dialogue that’d surely crack up the CBS writing room:

*“Sheldon, do you want a piece of pie?”*

*“A piece of pie? Are you asking if I want to divide 3.14? If so, what should I divide it by? (pulls out calculator)”*

*(CANNED LAUGHTER)*

I would rather watch a CW show than endure reruns of the Big Bang Theory, everyone I know either hates the show or absolutely loves it, my friend watches the show daily and every time we hang out and I'm driving us around the block and he makes a ""funny"" Bazinga joke I want to jump out of my moving car. But if you think there's nothing to rant about anymore because the show is over well you're WRONG! A spinoff show of the Big Bang Theory was made and focuses on the WORST CHARACTER in the show as Young Sheldon. I already found first Sheldon annoying in the original show but having him as a smartass child with his religious parents just makes the humor much more unbearable.

In Young Sheldon, the Dad likes sports and other stereotypical manly things and is also a couch potato, just like every other sitcom dad trope like the dad in The Goldbergs (which I also hate but not to the extend of The Big Bang Theory because there is no reason for it to have lasted this long and be an American TV icon). Sheldon and his dad are polar opposites and the writers think that this is funny even though this formula has been seen in movies, TV shows, and books HUNDREDS of times. There was this one episode where the dad wants Brisket and he goes to his wife and yells ""WHERES MY BRISKET"" and that was supposed to be the funniest thing ever.

So no, I will not buy any Sheldon Funko Pops, I will not buy that Bazinga shirt, and I will never think that knocking on a door three times and saying the residents name is the pinnacle of comedy. I HATE THE BIG BANG THEORY and my teacher back in high school who would not stop referencing the show in chemistry this is why you never had engaging students like the time you said that a student reminded you of Raj because he couldn't talk to girls without getting nervous. Whenever I'm in a study group and I hear a quirky kid say a bazinga joke I try to join another study group because if I have to hear Bazinga one more time I'm going to go into cardiac arrest!

The average viewer of these shows have to be geriatric octogenarians that sip wine and think Howard is hot, no sane young person would binge watch this show and not get bored there is a reason why they only screen two episodes at a time because if they let it play nonstop the viewer would start seeing a pattern in how the show is written. At least in Young Sheldon there is no laugh track and no bazingas but I still hate it I hate it I hate it. Anyone who thinks this show is the epitome of sitcoms needs to reevaluate their choices. No there is no ""I don't need sleep I need answers"" moment here, its that plain and simple, The Big Bang Theory is a horrible show.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/kuwruf/i_hate_the_big_bang_theory_and_my_roommate_is/,CDBoma,1,2021-01-11 01:10:05,40,/r/wsu/comments/kuwruf/i_hate_the_big_bang_theory_and_my_roommate_is/

kvc6iw,Does anyone want to answer some questions from a (possibly) incoming student?,"Hi! I'm 17, graduating in '22. I want to go into architecture, and since the only 2 architecture schools in WA are UW and WSU, I have a couple questions. If this isn't allowed in this sub, let me know and I'll take it down right away. 

1. How is Pullman/Student life? I've seen video tours of the town, and it looks like my kind of place. However, I've heard that WSU is a party school, so what's that like? I'm not typically a party-goer so would this school not be right for me?
2. How expensive was it for you guys? I know the website says it would be about $22k a year without any aide, but after scholarships and whatnot, about how much should I expect it to cost? (If you don't mind sharing financial information, of course).
3.  I want to go into architecture, so has anyone done that program and can tell me what it's like? I'm currently at a community college, so I would hopefully be transferring in and getting my general ed credits waived. 
4. If you have any more tips about student life or anything you think I should know, please tell me!

kx59dm,Is anyone else here skeptical about taking the vaccine (because it'll probably be made mandatory for WSU students),"First of all, I trust scientists and doctors and have been taking my necessary vaccine shots every time I need to. Yes, I'll wear my mask and wash my hands when I need to. However, I am still quite hesitant about the new vaccines that were made and are already rolling out across the country. There doesn't seem to be many problems with people who have already taken it, besides allergic reactions or whatever, but we also don't know if it may have long-term adverse effects. I understand that our technology and research has advanced so much that producing a viable vaccine would probably be possible in under a year, but I still feel like the time frame isn't wide enough to ensure its safety. It also did not help my confidence in the vaccine when the CEO of the Pfizer Corporation and its other executives didn't take the vaccine over some bs reason like ""we don't want to cut in line"". We are also unsure about the adverse long-term effects of Covid-19 but at least I can avoid getting it, and if I do get it I'll probably be fine (at least in the short-term). 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I have my doubts about the covid-19 vaccines which we will probably be forced to take. These doubts include the short time frame it was produced in, the monetary incentives of the corporations who distributed them, and possible long-term adverse effects. If anyone can enlighten me or improve my confidence in the vaccines, please try. &lt;3",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/kx59dm/is_anyone_else_here_skeptical_about_taking_the/,chandyego84,1,2021-01-14 08:05:23,0,/r/wsu/comments/kx59dm/is_anyone_else_here_skeptical_about_taking_the/

With camera use being mandatory in one of my classes and class start time being late at night, (5-8:30ish pm) do you think I should wait until fall term and hope I can take it in person? My home is not suitable for mandatory camera use, and especially at night. Also, are classes usually this late at the Vancouver campus? This is a mandatory class for my major and it also sounds awful to be at campus so late at night.

l79hyt,Sending the College's First Satellite to Space n' Shit,"Hi all.

WSU Pullman mechanical engineering senior here. Just doing a little infomercial for those of you on Reddit who aren't aware that there's a WSU engineering club who's current mission is to send the college's first satellite into space. 

For some reason I keep thinking more people who are in this college know about it, but there seems to be too many juniors coming in who keep saying *""how did I not know about this for so long?!?!asdnasjnisajdnfjdfn.*"" 

So here you go. Cougs in Space. We send satellites to space. Students who've been a part of this club have gotten internships at NASA, SpaceX, and Lockheed Martin. We also used to be sponsored by a now-defunct asteroid mining company called Planetary Resources. If you don't think that's cool, ya can leave this fucking post now. 

We have 8 teams you can join depending on your major (9 if you ask the right people) that allow you to do everything from develop satellite solar boards, to embedded systems programming in C (was your wet dream fulfilled when you took Cpts 12? Cool, we've got a team for you), orbital mechanics planning, to hardware testing and manufacturing. We even have a fucking marketing team, so you business majors don't get off scott-free.

If you're interested in learning more, here's our website. Click ""get involved."" Do as much or as little as you'd like.

With the pandemic, and the campus closing down last semester, I opted to stay in my home state for the whole year. With that, I've done some overthinking and I am wondering if it's really worth it for me to continue studying at this school. I'm technically undecided, but I am taking business courses and some UCORE stuff at the moment. I like most of the classes, but because I don't know much about this school (all of my campus visits got cancelled last year, so I've never even been to Pullman) and I'm not sure if I'm getting a better education than I could get at another institution in my own state. The reasons I would like to stay enrolled at WSU are that I've met some great people over social media so far and I received a scholarship that nearly equates the cost of this school to one I could attend in-state. Bottom line: I'm conflicted and would love to hear more about how others have felt about their overall experience and quality of education at WSU.

l9qkql,Faculty Senate ad hoc committee response to athletic funding: WSU Faculty members oppose funding the athletics department an additional 2-3 million dollars in the middle of the pandemic.,"On January 19th, 2021, the WSU Faculty Senate released this statement:

"" On December 15, 2020, the Faculty Senate Executive Committee formed an ad hoc committee to formalize a statement to the Board of Regents concerning the proposal that 2-3 million dollars be diverted from unallocated university funds in order to support athletics. This ad hoc committee has produced a statement that is now open for signing. ""

[https://facsen.wsu.edu/2021/01/19/ad-hoc-committee-response-to-athletic-funding/](https://facsen.wsu.edu/2021/01/19/ad-hoc-committee-response-to-athletic-funding/)

This deeply disturbs me due to the fact that I feel as though that 2-3 million dollars could be used on things that benefit the faculty and the students. We, as professors and students, are currently suffering mentally and financially due to the pandemic. The other day my friend and I, who was experiencing depression, called the WSU Cougar Health services to get her a therapist, but they informed us that the soonest we could schedule her an appointment was February 29th (we called in on January 11th). That 2-3 million dollars would be more than sufficient to help WSU students (and possibly even professors) with their mental health. Additionally, many professors and departments are experiencing budget cuts.  It doesn't make too much sense to me as to why they are choosing to fund the athletics department more than it needs, I mean, to some degree college sports as a whole has been put on hold/has a limited capacity. Don't get me wrong, I like sports too, but I don't think they should be a priority in the middle of a pandemic.

Here are some quotes from some faculty members I found to be informative:

"" I fully support this recommendation. our mission should be focused on our students, their success and the completion of their degrees. we cant do that when faculty salaries are being cut, departments are being shut down and people are being furloughed. the BOR needs to find an alternative way to fund athletics. thank you to the faculty senate for this recommendation. ""

"" The Faculty Senate letter is on point and I agree with it. Suppose a student gained admission to both Harvard and Alabama. Does it not sound insane if they said, “Sure, Harvard would advance my career a thousand percent better than Alabama, but Alabama’s football team is better, so I’m going there.” I love athletics, but there is nothing crucial about athletics, and the fact that we have become dependent on television revenue is simply poor management. Our mission statement ([https://wsu.edu/about/leadership/](https://wsu.edu/about/leadership/)) lays out our priorities nicely, and I affirm its spirit.""

"" Every year for the past decade Athletics has proposed budgets that get their spending under control, and then the Board of Regents approves. They have never achieved any of their goals, and yet the BOR never holds them accountable. It needs to stop. ""

"" I fully support the committee statement. WSU faculty and staff push their limits and do their best to deliver high-quality education to our students and continue their research despite the difficult circumstances. Many undergraduate and graduate students struggle financially and mentally. We need to spend this kind of money to support our students and faculty. It is very discouraging to hear that university is planning to use its funds to continue to spoil its athletic department while academic units get budget cuts. ""

B4Grad has since grown and we got a major boost by the pandemic that the world has been facing.

We are looking for students to test the product as we launch several new features this upcoming semester including our note editor. You can send us the feedback via email or write a review on the App Store. That’s it.

And in exchange, we’ll give you the premium version of the app for free. It’s that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit.

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn’t good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has.

I’m not sure how many people this will apply to, but I’d rather let more people know... So I’m an incoming freshman for Fall of 2021, and my high school GPA is a 3.55.

Given that my GPA is .05 off of that, I assumed I was out of luck, and essentially missing out on $16,000 over 4 years, BUT I emailed my admissions advisor and she said that starting this year, you can actually appeal that. I haven’t been accepted for the appeal yet, but I’m hoping that I am, and even if I’m not, I hope that this can help someone else.

m5t8zg,Why joining Greek life during covid will positively impact your time at WSU,"You will actually be able to make friends at school 

Because there is no “hallway interactions” this school year because of covid it makes it extremely hard to meet random people and make them into friends. 

Now If your into athletics, then you could meet people at the urec. 

But assuming you don’t play sports like that, then your chances of making a substantial amount (5-7) of INTIMATE friends anywhere else is small. 

Social interaction is essential to every aspect of your health.

As we all know, Isolation leads to feelings of loneliness and depression. 

If you don’t like to party you can join a house like acacia or farmhouse.

But Greek life is not just about partying, especially during a pandemic 
 
I found a brotherhood through my fraternity 

I also found 5-6 close friends I trust

I’ve also met different people on campus that I would never have if I didn’t join.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/m5t8zg/why_joining_greek_life_during_covid_will/,boneman1469,1,2021-03-15 15:52:29,3,/r/wsu/comments/m5t8zg/why_joining_greek_life_during_covid_will/

How am I supposed to make all this if I don't know which dorm I'm going to be put in? I have a few options where I would be in classes in general university classrooms and then have 10 minutes to get to another class. Is that realistic in Pullman?

mslmec,My two cents,"I don't care if you throw insults at me or whatever, do you really think I care at this point? No, I don't and whatever weak insults you throw at me won't work anytime around. Because here is the thing, your essentially giving me praises and medals for saying the truth. So actually, thankyou :), I appreciate it. Weather your a crying girl who's using her simping powers to get what she wants or a dude trying to be a hero and win a girls heart, it ain't going to work.

&amp;#x200B;

And I know that a specific group of people who will be crying are the hypocritical Greek people. Personally, nothing against you guys but hey, whos the group who put us back in Phase 2? Again, you already screwed, want to make things worse? Bark here then :/

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the Actual 2 cents

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have come to terms that COVID has become a game, and I'm tired of listening to our masters order when he has no reason on why we went back. What because your own people from the side came here and fck things up because were the ""east"" side or even the same in Idaho? Yet, being hypocritical and telling us to wear a mask and f you for voting sane policies that would have saved Seattle? Give me a break, oh wait you won't because our generation is shit period.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm here to say is this, who are we to listen to our states orders? Are we slaves or people? I don't care what Inslee says and neither should you. Want to celebrate someone birthday, do it. Want to BBQ do it. Want to train do it and whatever you want. 

Do you know what, I guarantee you that they will keep saying that there are new strains of Corona viruses all over again. I doubt will get back to normal until we do something and start being rebels. I mean how was this country founded again? Yeah, that's what I thought.

I wish President Skulz had the mindset of Governor Desantis, and went against the norm. Imagine what kind of school we would have been. I don't care about ""but we would be high"", ""people will die"", ""we will be high in the country"". These ridiculous arguments are getting old and are easily counterbled and refuted badly. But hey go ahead and someone will come at you :). What's even sad for me is that he's an engineer and so am I. I'm going to say that he brings shame to engineers, but don't they all?

If you don't want the vaccine, then don't get it. But don't brag about it or piss on people who did. I got it because of my mom. I got the J&amp;J and personally I'm happy I got it now then ever before. But you do you.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I'm done ranting. Who cares if the UREC is close? Improvise, buy sand from Moscow building supply and improvise. At the end of the day, you pay to be fit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to wear a mask, and I'm going to have fun. If I die from COVID-19, I don't care. At least I didn't die from a hand gun when people die from that in ""places"" or car accidents because we want to be ""bad asses"". Or even better, we are too lazy that we get fat and then die because out body rots in the inside.

I am deciding between WSU and another school. So, I wanted to know what do you think about WSU? What do you like about this school and why did choose that school? How are the people/ teachers in general? 
    Also, I heard that the CS major is more theoretical than practical, they do not teach the basic stuff and it is not really great. (It was from years ago). Is it true?

mz51wu,Admissions Difficulty,"Hey there all, before i get into the actual question, I’ll start off with some backstory:

All throughout life, I’ve never liked school. I’ve dreaded it as long as i can remember. Growing up, I’ve always wanted to join the military, so I decided that I was just going to enlist in the army and carry out life that way. However, plans change. My parents are divorced and I currently live in North Carolina with my mom, and my dad lives in Spokane. When junior year of high school rolled around, I gained a boost in my academic drive, and i brought my grades up quite significantly. Fast forward to my senior year (now), my dad invites me to visit him for thanksgiving. Throughout my life, my parents have been preaching to me “go to college before you join the army, life will be much better for you,” but again, i never really thought school was my thing. While I was with my dad for the week I was there, I absolutely fell in love with Washington. More so than I was before (I grew up on JBLM before my parents divorced). Finally, I made the decision to pursue college in the state and make up for lost time with my dad. Unfortunately however, because of COVID, my academics took a HUUUGEEE hit, as in me literally on the border of passing and failing my classes due to missing work, and anything before my junior year is just about useless to me anyway, but my ACT scores do workin my favor (24 overall).

Since November, I’ve been keeping in touch with the ROTC instructors at the school and they seem like they really want me, despite my history for poor grades. The admissions office is another story. I haven’t been denied, but i haven’t been accepted either because my counselor won’t provide me with my transcript. I guess my culminating question is, how difficult is it to get through the admissions office with my academic history and current standings? (current standings are improving as I tackle my daunting amount of work.)

TL;DR: School’s never been my thing, visit dad in Spokane, he convinces me to pursue college there in WA, junior year grades are great, but senior grades take a hit with COVID. In good with the folks that run ROTC, but scared admissions will deny me and I can’t attend and become an officer while spending lost time with my dad, i wanna know how difficult it is to get past admissions and to get accepted into WSU",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/mz51wu/admissions_difficulty/,SnoopyTrash,1,2021-04-26 14:57:27,10,/r/wsu/comments/mz51wu/admissions_difficulty/
mz8pdv,Transfer Student Advice!!,"Hi! I love reddit because I can truly find any subreddit group when I want some sort of advice 

So I’m currently a portland state sophomore student and got accepted to wsu ( pullman campus ) for Fall 2021 because I’ve been debating transferring since last year. As a transfer student, obviously meeting people and making friends would be the most worrisome thing. I was also thinking to live in student dorms just to be surrounded by other students - even though I know a lot of Juniors probably wouldn’t be living in campus dorms anymore but I think that would be the best option. How likely is it that I’ll transfer and not meet anyone since everyone has their friend groups and probably live off campus? I’d love to know about campus/student life too since I’d be coming from a very “commuter based” school.

n215g0,WSU Wants To Sell Off-Campus Property That Was Home To Stubblefields,"via Pullman Radio News:

 

Washington State University wants to sell its College Hill off-campus property that has been home to 2 popular student bars.

An informational item to the WSU Regents shows that the administration intends to sell Adams Mall.  WSU bought the building in 2004 for 1.5 million dollars under former President V. Lane Rawlins.  The purchase was part of Rawlins’ plan to revitalize College Hill.

At the time Shakers bar was operating inside Adams Mall.  That business closed in 2005 and Stubblefields bar opened in the space that same year.  Stubblefields closed last Summer.

According to the report to the regents the 36,000 square foot building has been managed by Corporate Pointe Developers in Pullman.  WSU has received 10% of the gross revenues generated from the property which the administration describes as “minimal income.”

The report notes that Adams Mall continues to be a center for College Hill nightlife and is a liability for the university.  The administration says they want to sell the property because it isn’t mission critical for the university.

The WSU Regents will be meeting virtually next week.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/n215g0/wsu_wants_to_sell_offcampus_property_that_was/,Ala_Tipster,1,2021-04-30 15:14:25,1,/r/wsu/comments/n215g0/wsu_wants_to_sell_offcampus_property_that_was/

The rest of the tuition/fees are covered. I will be working a part-time job, unless I am told that it’s an AWFUL idea to work &amp; be in school. I am going in for business administration/marketing or finance probably marketing. I was thinking Orton or Rogers which, if my financial aid doesn’t come through from WSU, will cost $300/mo out of pocket for the 4 years I stay there.

We can argue whether the vaccine is safe or whether covid is as dangerous as society thinks it is but the truth is if not enough of us vaccinate it will spread and the school will shut down again. I can’t handle another semester of this garbage, overpriced, half assed education. Get vaccinated please!

Obviously if you have a medical reason not to vaccinate (which is a very very small amount of people) that is different. Which adds to the argument you choosing to not getting vaccinated is putting people with poor immune systems (where vaccines don’t work for them) at risk making you indirectly responsible for their possible death.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/n48ma0/please_get_vaccinated/,throwitaway19284,1,2021-05-03 18:00:29,109,/r/wsu/comments/n48ma0/please_get_vaccinated/

This summer I will work full-time (32*15*4), and then I will buy a car. A nice one. 11 months ago my life went upside down, and I have moved 6 times since. Still, my grades are okay because online school has benefitted me. 
I am a female, and I was looking at Rogers just because it is cheap. Going to school for 100% free is a goal of mine, but I put a finance sheet together... and I think I want to look at a better dorm.
It will be for four years, and the $1,600 savings/mo (savings!!!) is consistent through college so long as I keep a part-time job. Q: Is a part-time job and college hard to manage? 

I join this reddit and everyone says southside is bad- but how much more expensive is northside? I wanted to schedule an appointment with my advisor but the website is not working for me. I am still waiting on my financial aid package too! That is why at the bottom of the sheet it says ‘dorm $400’, if I don’t get extra aid I will be paying $400/mo for Rogers. I am willing to pay up to $650-$700/mo, and seemingly overwhelmed with due dates. I know there is a dorm estimator but I wanted personal opinions. What are the better dorms to live in? 
I am wanting to bring my ESA &amp; live in an all-girls dorm preferably or a dorm with ‘mature males’, a semi-private bathroom and I am going in for Business Administration/Marketing but need like 1 more trimester to finish my AA.

n9zayb,Regents? Best dorm?,"Tell me about it! I went from graduating with BA for low debt, but now since picking Regents over Rogers/upgrading my options, my debt is $15k more (50%). 30k for a bachelors is not a lot, but I need to be able to pay that right out of college. That’s very easy if my living space is good enough to work in. 
At this point my debt is getting pretty DECENT, so should I just go all-in on a good dorm? What are the TOP choices? Going into business but need 1-2 trimesters to finish my AA.
Female, first dorm ever, will have ESA chinchilla, wanting double w/single occupancy and semi-private bathroom. Biggest priority is studying, and being able to sleep. I also need good internet!

I plan on doing a very part-time job &amp; building a business while in college. I need to focus on the business, or my goals will not be reached. I am going to college to learn business, not get my business degree. I hope that makes sense. I do not plan on working for anyone else in business unless it is an internship.

nfh3es,Summer catch-up (DTC related),"Hey Cougs,

As a student in the DTC major, I just finished my third year and have one year left to go before graduation.

My last DTC class was DTC 355 Multimedia Authoring where I was walked through HTML and CSS. 

Due to attending community college classes on a consortium agreement, I rarely had any free time to let my coding class information sink in. 

After the middle of June, I won’t have any ongoing classes and will be completely free with my time until fall semester starts back up on Aug. 23rd. 

At this point, my HTML and CSS skills and understanding is pretty limited and shaky, and I would rather wait to attempt an internship next summer when I could be of more use to a company.

Does anyone have advice for a tricky situation like this? I really want to improve before I go back in Fall. 

*We have used freecodecamp, but for me, it was still a bit confusing unfortunately. 
I’ve also encountered freecodeacademy and had the same reaction to that as well.

nlqiam,Rule Update,"Hey cougs,

Over the past few months we've noticed an increase in the amount of name calling and harassment taking place in the comments of posts. This is particularly the case on Covid-19 related topics as many people have differing views. Because of this, we have updated our rules to explicitly cover name calling, doxxing, and harassment and will be enforced more aggressively moving forward.

Constructive and educational conversation are fantastic for opening up a dialog between two differing opinions and are one of the only ways people change their beliefs. We love seeing when cougs back up their opinions with legitimate outside sources others can go check out. Unfortunately, it's more common that these conversation devolve into name calling others ""idiots"" or ""morons"" which is what this new rule set intends to avoid. Additionally, as with any sub, we do have our consistent trolls in the comments who only look to get reactions out of people. If you know who these are, it's best to not engage and simply ignore.

At the end of the day, no matter our personal opinions, we are all part of the cougar family. We come from all over the world with differing backgrounds, religions and experiences and all deserve the same level of respect. That's the cougar spirit.

Go cougs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/nlqiam/rule_update/,Happydude789,1,2021-05-26 16:20:56,10,/r/wsu/comments/nlqiam/rule_update/

nsdqfj,For the love of god can someone give me one damn good logical reason that the on-campus apartments are 11 month contracts.,Okay so I moved out May 8th turned in keys and cancelled the contract. According to housing if I don't cancel before April 1st I have to pay through june. Which it does say that in the contract I signed I guess. So basically you either have to move out a month before the semester ends and fail your classes or you move out after classes end and pay a whole month that you are not living there. I understand normal apartments are one year contracts but university apartments are not normal. Why in the actual frick would you make a contract that ends almost two months after school gets out. The only logical reason for this is so the school can jib another month of rent out of you which is arguably highly unethical. Is there literally any reason for this other than for the school to grossly rip you off. Because in my eyes this is horse shit and I wish I could start a petition to change on-campus housing contracts to run from august to may. That logically makes sense as no one would live there in june unless they are working or doing summer school which then they would pay for a summer contract anyways.

I am transferring from Seattle Central College this fall to the WSU Global Campus with an aim at completing the Criminal Justice/ Criminology Program. 

I will be using the GI Bill, so I’m not worried about the cost of education. 

More so, I am wondering about the rigor of courses through the global campus? 
How are the proffesors, will I be communicating mostly with grad student aides? 

I’ve only ever known the quarter system. If anyone has experienced the transition from quarter to semester, how was it? 
I know how the math works out, but 20 credit hours at a quarter system or 18 credit hours at semester based system is different, I’m wondering how much so? Obviously there’s more courses to take, but is the workload equivalent or have you found it to be more or less? 

Also, My first year out of the military was rough. My gpa suffered greatly, I’ve been able to maintain 3.8-4.0 for the last year and half. However, my cumulative GPA is still low due this, I have researched how to raise it.

It isn’t that I hate stem it’s more that if like a major that plays towards my current string suits while also having a need for it in the job market. I was looking at one called data analytics but that’s just about the only one I’ve found so far. Does anyone else have a similar issue to this or have found a solution/idea to the problem?

okfj6b,I’’m incredibly worried about my math placement test.,"Hi! I’m an incoming freshman for the fall and I have procrastinated my placement tests for a while now, my orientation is in a few weeks so I decided to get cracking this weekend. I have confidence in my writing ability so I’m not to worried about the essay. The math test is a different story though. I took statistics in my senior year and I didn’t feel like I fully completed pre-calc in Junior year because of COVID’s first outbreak. I feel super underprepared and really anxious because of it. Any advice or tips on the math test would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/okfj6b/im_incredibly_worried_about_my_math_placement_test/,megamariner,1,2021-07-14 18:39:46,23,/r/wsu/comments/okfj6b/im_incredibly_worried_about_my_math_placement_test/
ol19e9,UW Pre-Sciences vs WSU CS?,"I'm a recent HS grad in WA State who needs to make a decision about where to go to college next fall. I've been admitted to UW Seattle for Fall 21, but I wasn't accepted directly into the CS department. I was also admitted to UWB CSSE, WWU and WSU. WSU would probably be my top choice out of these, so I thought I'd get input from current WSU students.

What's my best option if my goal is to get a job as a SWE at one of the more competitive companies in Seattle or SF? 

1. Go to UW Seattle and try to get into CSE or one of the good tech-related majors (ACMS, INFO, EE). Try to ace everything and have good ECs/essays to make myself as competitive as possible. Major in Math or Physics and take non-majors CS courses or transfer out if it doesn't work out. CS, Informatics, EE, and Applied math are all nearly impossible to get into now because the school switched to mostly accepting people into the competitive majors directly out of high school, so even if I ace everything and have a strong app I'll probably still have to end up majoring in pure math.



2. Go to a community college, compete an associates in CS and reapply to 4-year schools as a transfer student. Probably my best chance at getting into UW CSE since they switched to mostly DAs. Easy 4.0s, so I probably have a decent shot at getting in as along as my essay is strong. Reapply to UWB and WWU as backups in case I don't get into UW CSE.  I can also apply to strong OOS schools like UMich, USC, UCs, UMaryland, etc and consider taking out loans for my last two years. 



3. Just go to WSU, UWB or WWU and avoid all the time/stress associated with applying to majors or transferring schools. Will have to grind/network harder to get interviews at top companies. 



Thanks a lot!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/ol19e9/uw_presciences_vs_wsu_cs/,Mmscjfkejdnc,1,2021-07-15 16:30:46,2,/r/wsu/comments/ol19e9/uw_presciences_vs_wsu_cs/

In light of WSU football coach Nick Rolovich's recent public statement that he will use a personal exemption and not receive the COVID vaccine, I will be staging a protest at the entrance of WSU. Rolovich's statement is an embarrassment to WSU and the Pullman community. He is the highest paid employee of the university, and we should not be supporting his outbursts at the cost of our university's reputation as a leader in scientific research.  

We'll be standing at WSU's southern entrance, in front of the ""Washington State University"" signs at the base of Stadium Way. The more the merrier, so I'm posting this to see if people would like to join in. I'll be there at 5 pm today (Saturday the 24th), and possibly tomorrow if there is growing support. Bring signs advocating for vaccination, and highlighting the responsibility of WSU to keep its students and the residents of Pullman safe. Also, please bring water and follow COVID guidelines.

I love him so much. If I have to go back home again after graduating it'll be really hard to escape my situation here &amp; would probably take years because they treat me like a ten year old and didn't let me even go outdoors alone up until a month ago. I don't want to go back to that, I'd rather dissolve into thin air.

My problem is; most apartments I can find online cater towards students (e.g. $600 rent for a four bedroom), but I would like to find something affordable (max $750\~ rent) that can house just my Fiancee and I. (One bedroom, kitchen, one bathroom, not shared). 

Does anyone know where to look, or where to start looking? Any apartment suggestions? I really don't want to end up getting married and still living in shared housing because it'd be really awkward.

&gt;The Whitman County Commissioners have banned camping where a homeless camp has emerged along the Snake River.  
&gt;  
&gt;The board unanimously approved the ordinance following a public hearing on Monday morning.  No one testified during the hearing.  
&gt;  
&gt;The camping ban is for the county right of way along 27 miles of Wawawai Road between the state line and Wawawai County Park.  A homeless camp with several campers, vehicles and tents has popped up along the road near the Port of Wilma.  There have been two fires in the camp this Summer.  People who violate the ban would face a possible trespassing charge.  You can listen to Commissioner Michael Largent explain his vote by clicking on the link below.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ordinance notes that the area is popular for recreation and that there is legal camping nearby on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers property and Wawawai County Park.  The law also points out that the pullouts where the encampments are located are not intended for camping.  
&gt;  
&gt;The camping ban takes effect today.

A fire is burning on Moscow Mountain this morning.

Moscow Rural Fire Department Volunteers were called to the blaze around 2:30 after a thunderstorm rolled through the area.  Chief Brian Nickerson says the fire is burning about 5 acres of slash and timber.  Crews were assembling and trying to get to the blaze around sunrise this morning.  Idaho Department of Lands and Moscow City Volunteer Firefighters have been called in to assist.  The fire is on the slope of the mountain near the radio towers on West Twin.  Nickerson believes the fire was likely sparked by lightning.

The fire is estimated at between 10 and 15 acres.  Aircraft have been ordered to help fight the flames.

The fire is burning on the North slope of the mountain just below the top of the ridge.

(I’m not sure why there’s a discrepancy of the fire burning on both the north and south slopes.

oze1xi,Critique on WSU's COVID-19 Fall Semester Plan,"Hey all, 

I am new to Reddit but I wanted to post something I wrote regarding WSU's plan for the upcoming Fall semester (hopefully that's okay). With WSU being an R1 research university, I had hoped that they would be quick to adapt to changing guidelines and follow the science. However, their sluggish pace and insufficient policies regarding masking, submitting proof of vaccination, and allowing students who are immunocompromised, live with children under 12 years of age or other immunocompromised people, or who just do not want to engage in this social experiment to take classes online is troubling. As a graduate student and teaching assistant, I want to raise my concerns regarding the community that WSU may be endangering with these inconsistencies.

Let me know what you think! And if this is as concerning to you as it is to me, please contact WSU administration and the access center with these concerns. Getting remote accommodations should not be limited to a select few medical conditions and needless hoops to jump through. There are students and faculty who live with children under the age of 12 or with immunocompromised people that would not be permitted to get online access to courses. Given the past year, this should not be an unreasonable ask.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/oze1xi/critique_on_wsus_covid19_fall_semester_plan/,Newts2Boot,1,2021-08-06 15:46:34,27,/r/wsu/comments/oze1xi/critique_on_wsus_covid19_fall_semester_plan/

ozmpcc,Mental Health,"Hey everyone, i’m a recent graduate of WSU. Last year a few months before i graduated my partner took her own life. She was very stressed about school, life, making friends, covid and living in pullman. My brother is gonna be attending WSU again in the fall and he also struggled with mental health. The reason for me posting this is because i know how hard the struggle of being a young person going to college, trying to find yourself, and the pressures of being an adult can be. Please take advantage of the counselling at wsu. School counselling is never the best but compared to other schools and just therapist in general, WSU caps is actually a wonderful resource. Take a break every chance you get. I know how hard the pressure is to succeed but it’s not everything. I come from a low income family and tough upbringing and college was legit my only option to have any chance of success but now that i’ve graduated i realised the undue pressure society and myself put on a degree. If you need a semester off take it, if you need a year off take it. Time is not limited contrary to what the world would have you believe. Most of all try to be there for one another. You never know if you could literally save a life. Good luck this semester and always remember a phrase that my professor once told me whenever you encounter a difficult situation. “This too shall pass”",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/ozmpcc/mental_health/,pokehoe1397,1,2021-08-07 00:32:26,12,/r/wsu/comments/ozmpcc/mental_health/

p27ume,Brainstorm on WSU's covid policy,"I'm curious what can be done (if anything) about WSU's increasingly absurd covid policy. Sure, the school needs money and wants the college experience back, yadda yadda. But we as students, staff, faculty and families will be affected, not the people making these decisions who will never have to enter a stuffy classroom full of hundreds of questionably-vaccinated unmasked students. 

As a student I feel I have no voice. I could wait a semester to  finish my degree, but is that entirely fair? No, it's not right for these people to set policies that endanger literally everyone, and we have to go along with it or delay our education. It's complete bullshit and as a parent of a child under 12, I felt sick to my stomach reading their corporate-esque responses about how ""herd immunity"" and ""90% effectivity"" will keep us all safe.

So, getting on to the point of this post (sorry for the rant), I'd like to hear from the diverse population of r/wsu - professors, students, staff, alumni, and everyone else - what can we do? What us the most effective way for us to show that our lives and families are more important than ""getting the college experience""? Is it a protest, or a walkout, or something else? Please let us find a way.

As things are winding back up again, I was just wanting to share a couple things, specifically to people new to pullman/wsu.

 [https://discord.gg/kNmXmND](https://discord.gg/kNmXmND)

##### I would also highly recommend that people join clubs and stuff early. You can meet lots of new people, get good connections for jobs and internships, and have a fun time. If you want to join a couple engineering clubs dm me, or find events where multiple present. There are lots, including a ton of just random ones. I hear cookie club is nice.

Are you feeling lost on campus? Well, you're definitely not alone. I made a Discord server for WSU\* students and alumni in June of 2020 due to COVID and we have since grown to 1600 members. We have our own dedicated Minecraft server, host movie and game nights, and keep everyone updated on the happenings around campus. Feel free to drop in and say hi anytime! The people in our community are more than happy to help answer any of your questions or help you find a group of people to hang out with. We have a very active staff team who are able to assist you with whatever you need (seriously, anything).

Also, if you are part of a club and looking for members, DisCougs might be a great advertising platform for you! I'm happy to work with anyone with any sort of advertising/recruitment. I have a specific channel just for you guys to use! The server currently has a majority freshman/sophomore audience so there will be lots of students looking for things to do around campus! 

If giant discord servers aren't your thing, we also have a channel that advertises smaller WSU discord servers for specific clubs and classes! The other popular servers include the WSU Gaming Community, The WSU Engineering Study Group, Palouse Music Community, WSU LGBTQ+, and the WSU CS Study Group.

Hope to see you here :)

p76g10,Some advise for incoming Freshman,"I’ve made a few similar posts in past years detailing things I wish I knew heading to WSU. This is tailored towards business students because that’s what I know, but hopefully applicable to more than that. 

One thing that is true with a WSU degree and has been for years. is that nothing is guaranteed from going to WSU, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make anything from a WSU degree. It’s a school where you get out what you put in, I know a lot of people who went on to work for companies like Microsoft, Amazon, KPMG, Boeing as well as a lot of people who got great positions at smaller companies. 4 years later, these people are being promoted and finding a ton of success. I also knew a lot of people who didn’t take things seriously, struggled to find work and especially struggled to find work in their field. There are a lot of companies that want to hire Cougs, but they want to make sure they are getting a hard worker and someone who will be good for them. 

1. Get good grades. I heard throughout all of high school, grades won’t matter in college, they do. They’re an easy way to do a high level review and separate people. Companies view them as a barometer of how hard you’re willing to work. There are certainly exceptions to that, but finding work you want will be a lot easier with better grades.  Especially freshman classes which are easy, there are a ton were you can pass with a C giving minimal effort. A 4.0 in that class is worth just as much as a 4.0 in a senior level class. Build a strong foundation early so when Junior/Senior year come around, you’re under less pressure to have to get good grades. 

2. Surround yourself with people you like to be around. Now that we’re back in person, take advantage of it. The people in your freshman classes, will be a lot of the same people in your senior classes. I’m friends 9 years later with people I met first semester freshman year in Econ 101. Having a group of people who push each other is a lot better than trying to do college on your own. 

3.  Push yourself out if your comfort zone. Early on in my college career, I was very focused on academics. I quickly found life is a lot more fun when you open the door to new opportunities. If someone invites you to something, take them up on it. College is a great time to make small mistakes, half the learning happens in the classroom, the other half, out of the classroom. Find a balance that works for you. 

4. Connect with professors. There are immediate benefits of the class, benefit of the doubt in grades, help understanding a concept or academic advise. As an alumni, I have asked professors I knew for letters of recommendation, career advise, industry connections and much more. Professors love what teach and have studied, they are oftentimes willing to help you out if you show a genuine interest in their subject. Certainly going to be exceptions, but by and large, a great resource for finding success. 

WSU is a fun place. Being isolated in the middle of nowhere develops a strong culture very few people experienced in college. Push yourself, grow, learn and have fun. Be stupid, learn from that. Prioritize what needs to be prioritized and become the version of you you want to be. The Coug community is real, if you need help, people will give you help. Talk to a roommate, RA, professor, ask on Reddit or feel free to message me. 

Good luck and Go Cougs!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/p76g10/some_advise_for_incoming_freshman/,StevenS145,1,2021-08-18 22:57:12,9,/r/wsu/comments/p76g10/some_advise_for_incoming_freshman/

The feature that's ready right now is group chats - it creates a group chat for every course, every term. In a lot of classes not enough people know each other for a group chat to get formed, or a lot of people are left out of it. So this should make it easier for people to connect. The group chats are in the Signal messaging app, which is a lesser known one but has really good privacy features.

paiqtf,"To any UX/UI designer, what is the best path to take to ""break into"" the industry?"," 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a freshman comp sci major that is doing terrible in all my classes right now, and I really want to go into UX or UI design but I have no clue how to do it. WSU doesn't offer a UX/UI major, so the closest I have is a major called  **Digital technology and culture major** which focuses on a mix between game design, digital production, and animation. Would I be okay majoring in this with a comp sci minor, or should I major in digital technology l instead? The only reason I haven't made the jump yet is that I'm worried I won't be able to land a job with that major since it's not directly UX/UI related, and sticking it out with comp sci would at least give me some job security and decent income. I truly can't see myself as a software engineer and always wanted to do something on the more creative side of tech anyway, and I know there would be no chance to really build my portfolio if I stay in comp sci since my course load is already pretty demanding and coding based. I guess in short what I'm asking is, to anyone in the field that has experience in design, which would help me ""break into"" the industry the most and give me the most leverage? The way I see it, my two options are:

1.) stay in comp sci and struggle, but have some sort of job security in case UX doesn't work, try to build a portfolio on the side

2.) switch to DTC and be able to work on my portfolio, but possibly get no internships or jobs, and no job security if things don't work out

pmdyxs,"Be aware, Hills Church is part of a network of churches with cult-like practices and is not safe for students.","[Hills Church](https://www.hillschurch.com) is part of a [network of churches](https://leavingthenetwork.org/network-churches/) led by Steve Morgan. Read a list of [abusive behaviors](https://leavingthenetwork.org/dysfunctional-church/) at these churches. Many things listed point to this network being a cult, such as information control, demand for purity, and control of who exists.

A few examples include:

• “""Prophecies"" and ""special revelations"" are presented by leaders during emotional and highly choreographed services at conferences, retreats, and team meetings to imply divine favor when the church needed money or resources for its continued expansion.”

• “Leaders and members are given specific sets of readings and urged not to read material outside the approved list. Making contact with experts outside the organization is discouraged. Leaders and members are discouraged from seeking professional counseling services from anyone outside the organization.”

• “Leaders are subjected to ""purity tests"" where their commitment to their leader is questioned if they do not obey with specific acts of compliance (such as agreeing with pastors on personal medical choices, sending their children to certain schools, refraining from tattoos, forbidding cremation as part of funeral rites for departed loved ones, and etc). If members do not obey their leaders, they risk getting less attention from the leader as well as the loss of their position within the group.”

• “To quote Steve's own words when describing his leadership of a young man: “We decided that we should talk with _____ more on the phone about the immaturity issues and see how he responds. So I asked him hard questions about how he was doing personally and about his relationship with a woman he was dating. The transparency and honesty with which he spoke to me instantly persuaded me that he was willing to be led and that his heart was good. […] This is why we raise up our leaders from within rather than 'hire' them from outside.”[[Morgan, Steve. “Our Story and How We Do Church,” Nov. 2011, pp. 72.](https://leavingthenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Steve-Morgan-Our-Story-and-How-We-Do-Church-Part-1-2011-redacted.pdf)] This story demonstrates how confession extracted via power differential (the confession was NOT mutual, Steve did not share as deeply as the young man did), was used as a determination of whether or not the man was ""willing to be led."" Loyalty was prized above all virtues, and the rite of passage was leveraged confession.”

Hundreds of us are suffering at the hands of this shitty 101 course, is there anything we can do?

poz05d,Have you reported sexual misconduct to a Washington state college or university? We’d like to hear from you," Hi there,

We're Asia Fields and Taylor Blatchford, and we work at The Seattle Times. We’ve written about Title IX systems at colleges in Washington state, and we’re hoping to take a deeper look in the next few months at how they’re working — or not working — when it comes to responding to sexual misconduct.

We’re hoping to talk with people who have reported sexual misconduct to Washington State University or other Washington colleges in the past several years, as well as others who have been involved in the Title IX process.

We’d appreciate it if you passed this on to others who might have relevant experience to share. A reporter will follow up with anyone who shares their story, and we won’t publish survivors' stories without explicit permission.

ppuldn,"Hypothesis: Frat Flu is caused by high COVID vaccination rates, and that's a good thing.","Judging by the amount of people coughing their brains out in my lectures but the relatively low COVID rates in Pullman, frat flu is here in full force. We know that masks and social distancing greatly reduce transmission of airborne diseases, as shown by last years data around the world. So what that means is airborne diseases are being spread, but not COVID.

While it seems the mask mandate is effective in preventing transmission of disease in the classroom, students are mingling day and night (a lot of times maskless). They still getting sick with respiratory illnesses, but just not COVID, even though the delta variant is extremely transmissible. 

Going off of the most recent available data from WSU administration, we are almost at 80% vaccinated rate for enrolled students. This just so happens to be the threshold for herd immunity of a disease with an r0 value of 5.0, which is what delta is estimated to be. 

Since not all who are vaccinated are immune to COVID and breakthrough cases do exist, we aren't at full herd immunity yet. But in combination with masking and being conscientious, we don't have much to worry about when it comes to COVID. So keep wearing your mask (over your nose!) and we will crush COVID.

We are doing great, and if we keep this up we have nothing to worry about. GO COUGS!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/ppuldn/hypothesis_frat_flu_is_caused_by_high_covid/,mntngoats,1,2021-09-17 02:07:34,16,/r/wsu/comments/ppuldn/hypothesis_frat_flu_is_caused_by_high_covid/

pspmrn,"A letter I have written to the University Ombudsman and campus police regarding safety concerns involving reckless use of electric scooters, bicycles, skateboards, and one wheels on Pullman campus.","*Hello,


I am a transfer student who has started school at the WSU Pullman campus this semester. Over the course of the past few weeks since classes have begun, I have had at least 10 run-ins with other students recklessly riding electric assisted scooters, bikes, skateboards, and one wheels. 


I Feel unsafe and on edge just walking through nearly every part of campus, especially high traffic areas between class periods. 


I am highly concerned about the safety risk posed by students recklessly riding these mobility devices for the sake of myself and my fellow students. I believe more needs to be done to address this problem before someone gets seriously hurt.


 According to WAC 504-15-930 - Bicycles, Skateboards and Roller Skates:


-Electric-assisted bicycles must be used in a human propulsion only mode on pedestrian malls and sidewalks.

-Motorized foot scooters must be used in a human propulsion only mode on sidewalks.

-Operators must move at a safe speed and yield to pedestrians at all times.  Reckless or negligent operation of bicycles, skateboards, scooters, and roller skates on any part of campus is prohibited.

I have not seen any evidence that these regulations are enforced on the Pullman campus at all. I found these regulations at the WSU Police's website, https://police.wsu.edu/bicycles-and-skateboards/ . 

Thank you all for your time and I hope to hear back from you.

If I had to guess there are about 50 spots in the north lot and maybe 60 in the south for 125 apartments (which house 3 to 4 students each) I legit just had to finagle my car into an unpaved area between the dumpster and an electrical box. It's ridiculous. To make matters worse, cheapskate commuters park here during class so that they don't have to pay for a color lot ticket. There's a parking lot that's usually always half empty about 5 feet away but you HAVE to live at that place to park there (Columbia apartments), or else you can expect a sneaky ticketer to slam a fat ass ticket onto your windshield. The cherry on top is that there are two spots specifically reserved for maintenance which I rarely see them parked in (I know their cars because they're specifically marked WSU MAINTENANCE or whatever). 

This shit show is a trap to get us to park in a different lot so that they can charge us with a parking ticket. I'M PISSED TF OFFFFFF. 

one more complaint- for a school that claims to be conscientious about recycling, it seems ass-backward to make 125 apartments share only 2 bins for recycling bottles and cardboard.

pvgmhv,It’s crazy when you actually knew the shooter,"I first got here in 2018 as a transfer student and a few of the clubs I joined were Black Student Union, NSBE, and Black Men Making a Difference. One of the leaders of BMMaD was George Harris III.  (the shooter from last night) At first he seemed like a nice dude and was known to be very active at Mike’s/Stubbies and various other parties around campus. 

However, I quickly learned how shady he was when he took the money from a Halloween fundraiser for BMMaD and pocketed it for himself. Not only that, he did that again with another party the next year except he cancelled the party and did not refund anyone the money while simultaneously flexing lavish trips and stuff to LA on Snapchat. 

When I saw the update of who the shooter was I was literally so in shock to see his name since I knew he graduated (or maybe not idk if he finished) but also I was like “yeah this dude definitely would do that”.

My first encounter with him was that when I used to work at Nike back on the west side, one of my coworkers had a fight with him and he told me about how he was always starting shit and super aggro. 

If anyone else knows him feel free to chime in but this is what I know about him personally.

pw9ou9,Junior and a half Comp Sci major struggling,"I need some advice from anyone who has some. I am a computer science major and am struggling hard. I used to have a passion for computer science and programming and I have since lost it, I borderline hate it. I don't even have the drive to create personal projects anymore. I think this is maybe because of covid and online school I'm not really sure. Basically, I am struggling in my classes, I don't enjoy it anymore, and I am way too much money in debt from college. I am to the point where I just want to get a degree because of how much I have already spent on education. I want to switch to an easier major so I can just get a degree at this point and figure out what to do after. Does anyone know of some degrees I could switch to that would add the least amount of years onto my education? Any advice? I know this post is vague but I am just trying to get ideas. I'm not sure if I can do computer science anymore, and looking at the classes I still have to take and the ones I am taking now makes me sick to my stomach. I wish I could go back and do something different but I ignored the early signs and now I feel shafted by the situation. I am too far in debt to not get a degree but I cant even get myself together enough to do a computer science degree.

I'm about to graduate with my BS in Computer Science and BS in Mathematics and am looking at PhD programs for CS in the Northwest US.

Anyway, WSU has caught my eye and I'd love any more information y'all could share about the place! Here are some questions I have, but I'd appreciate anything else you think is useful:

1. What's campus life like? Are there a lot of clubs and organizations (besides Greek Life)? What kind of events does the college try and organize?
2. Does the university feel more like a big city, small town, or a something in the middle?
3. What's the climate/weather like? Where I'm from it's normal to get into the low triple digits in July/August, and in February it usually gets into the teens for a week or two, but on average I'd say the spring, summer, and fall are hot &amp; humid, and the winter is mild/cool.
4. What's the outdoor scene like? I live in the Appalachian mountains right now, so hiking is one of my favorite past times. How common is backpacking, rock climbing, kayaking, camping, etc?
5. How does living on campus compare with living off campus?
6. What can you say about the Computer Science program? Professors, class sizes, difficulty, research areas- anything is helpful!

I’ve also heard that other people don’t recommend her and to pick another teacher. From what I’ve seen, she’s pretty obsessed with making sure people like the class but she isn’t doing that at all. The problems aren’t relevant, she keeps messing with the problems so we can’t view other sources to help us solve them, hell, she even ran a feedback assignment and all the “learning tools” people said were the least helpful.

q6xu3x,"Daily(?) Crapper Review - CUB Basement (M), 7/10","We all drop deuces, and we would all prefer to do it somewhere other than on campus.  That being said, it is an eventuality that you will have to do your duty somewhere on campus.  I do so more often than not, and in my infinite charity I have decided I will try and help others in the endless quest for the perfect shitter.

Firstly, here is an introduction to the system I will be using as well as some important miscellaneous points:

* I am a male, as such I will only be reviewing (M) men's and (I) inclusive restrooms.  Maybe someone will be willing to step up and review the other 50% of the restrooms on campus, but who knows.
* All stalls in a restroom will be assumed of equal quality, as will multiple ""rooms"" in one area (such as the inclusive restrooms in the Chinook).
* The grading system is subject to change, I have not perfected it and am open to any improvements.
* If there are any questions, concerns, or otherwise missed points of interest I will do my best to answer them in the comments.
* Will this actually be daily?  Who knows, it depends on how this post is received and whether or not I remember to make a post.

Now a bit more info on the grading system:

Right now I am using a 2 point grading system, 0 means horrible, 1 means acceptable, and 2 is perfect.  This is based on my personal opinion which is not absolute, nor is it applicable to everyone.  I will do my best to justify each rating within the review.  Here is a quick overview of each metric:

* Cleanliness:  Pretty self explanatory, I'm a bit of a germaphobe so this will be one of the harsher metrics.  A 2 would be very clean floors and toilets, a 0 would not be so bad as to outright prevent me from using the stall, but I would need to be very desperate to not find someplace else.
* Accessibility:  How easy is it to find an empty stall?  Pretty dependent on the time of use, but I believe it is still an important metric.  A 2 would be at least 3/4 of the stalls open, a 0 would be at most 1/4 of the stalls open.
* Traffic:  How many people are in the restroom at a given time?  How many people are coming and going?  Some of us are more shy than others so this metric is aimed at giving them some peace of mind.  A 2 would be no-one present during the entire duration, and a 0 score would be people perpetually rotating though.
* Comfort:  A toilet is a toilet, but some thrones are just better than others.  This includes the vibes too, nobody wants to be stuck in a small, sketchy room during their most vulnerable times.  I have a less solid metric explanation for this one because it's mostly feel, but I will try to elaborate my reasoning in the reviews.
* Visual Appeal:  Completely arbitrary but it matters to me, so I'm sure it matters to some of you.  I also needed something to round the score up to 10.  As with the Comfort scale, I will explain the reasoning for a certain score in the review.

There's some overlap with the metrics but this is the system I'm settling with for now.  I'm open to different systems though.

With that out of the way, lets get on to the review!

CUB Basement, men's restroom, 7/10

* Cleanliness: 2/2
* Accessibility: 2/2
* Traffic: 1/2
* Comfort: 1/2
* Visual Appeal: 1/2

Overall the CUB basement is one of my favorite places to do business because of it's cleanliness and lack of users.  The stalls are well maintained and the floors don't have that gross gritty, sometimes muddy feeling that higher use restrooms have  There are plenty of stalls and almost all of them are open at any given time.  Rarely have I encountered another stall user during my times of need.  There is still the occasional passer by, but most of the time it is pretty serene.  I removed a point from the comfort and visual appeal scores because most of the seats have scratches on them, as well as the overall layout of the restroom being rather cramped if you need to get around someone else.

Hopefully you will find this useful.  The future reviews won't have the initial explanation so they will be much shorter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/q6xu3x/daily_crapper_review_cub_basement_m_710/,basement_guy,1,2021-10-12 18:57:24,18,/r/wsu/comments/q6xu3x/daily_crapper_review_cub_basement_m_710/

This is an angrily written rant about WSUs response to and preparation for a full-capacity semester with COVID-19 still hanging around. 

WSU has been understaffed since at least 2019, and there has been no interest by the general population at filling those jobs. We aren’t even getting enough applicants to fill the positions if we hired everyone who applied. Some departments are still operating right now with the employee levels seen during the height of the pandemic, when everyone else was locked away at home. These departments are starting to really buckle under the weight of so many students and operations happening. 

The students do not give a shit. At all. It is a dog eat dog world and the students do not care. Sure, you might. Your neighbors dont. Those people that party all the time dont. The people that still dont understand how to wear their masks dont. The people that “lose” their masks at every single opportunity (because honestly, how else are there so many masks on the floors??) dont care. Some departments arent even able to finish all their work in a day before their shift is over, creating a pile of unending tasks that will never get done with the way things are currently. 

And the thing that has really just made me angry is the response or lack thereof, to COVID-19. WSU is not transparent about student COVID cases. Just look at the data provided by Virginia Tech on their student cases: [https://ready.vt.edu/dashboard.html](https://ready.vt.edu/dashboard.html). Wow! Imagine if we had data that looked like that instead of wondering if students are even tallied in with the Whitman county numbers. Staff members need a doctor’s referral to get tested, effectively delaying or halting some staff from getting tested when they need to. This is putting whole departments at risk, because if two or three members go down for a while, the department will stop. Or there will be a scramble to keep it going at a different department's expense. Also WSU keeps acting like COVID-19 or just “illness” is unforeseen still. They keep acting surprised when they need to cancel some event they scheduled. It is not a surprise, they just want as much of your money as possible while trying to look like a cool forward school while not giving a shit. Schulz can say that our numbers are low and that WSU has been doing all the right things, but that is not true. If it is true, show us the numbers. Are students counted in Whitman county or their home county? Every single picture that comes out from a social event WSU has hosted shows essentially no masks in sight. Not many employees even try to correct an incorrectly worn mask anymore because people are so whiny about it. Even when they’re “required” for the football games. 

COVID-19 numbers are already bad for Whitman county. Try as you might to argue with me that its not students. Just look at when our county started having rising cases. Please. Regular tailgating and partying is not helping, even if we are doing our job and wearing masks when grocery shopping or in classes. But I've heard even that is iffy. I am dreading this winter. I am praying WSU will shut down at least some operations. Sincerely, get fucked everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/q7j8v4/rant_from_a_full_time_employee/,angerburner,1,2021-10-13 15:55:15,67,/r/wsu/comments/q7j8v4/rant_from_a_full_time_employee/

One needs to be desperate to use the Owen library bathrooms for business.  The urinal layout requires a... bold individual willing to go elbow to elbow with the person next to them.  Most people opt to use a stall when one of the urinals are occupied for this reason, meaning that the seats are almost guaranteed to have a patter of urine on them at any given time.  The only redeeming quality of this place is that the desperate man can always find an open stall.  Despite the large number of restrooms there are still a lot of people coming in and out, but it's not horrible.  Comfort wise, it sucks.  The stalls are cramped to the point it's practically impossible to maneuver with a large bag.  The locks also have a weird notch where the latch is supposed to catch, so none of the stalls actually lock (I've checked multiple floors and they were all like this). They're also plain ugly.

I didn't sleep last night so apologies if my words don't word right.

This restroom is a little known gem from what I can gather. All the times I've used this restroom it has been vacant and the people I mention it to had no prior knowledge of it's existence.  For those who don't know, it is directly across from the quiet lounge down a short hallway.  Since it is a singe unit bathroom with a lock, you will achieve maximum privacy when you do business.  I removed both points from the comfort score because it is a rather small room with no ventilation that I could figure out.  I do not like being fumigated in a quagmire of my own creation.  Visually, it's well lit with an inoffensive color scheme so no points lost there.

This is one of my favorite crappers on campus.  I've only used it a few times but each time was a near perfect experience.  This is not a very often used restroom so it is almost spotless.  It has been empty every time I went there and I didn't encounter another soul during my entire stay.  There is a large window in the handicap stall that has been painted over but you can still hear the sound of a gentle breeze blowing against it, whisking all your worries away as you focus on the task at hand.  It is a paradise.  I knocked a point off of the visual appeal because like all the restrooms in the engineering sector it has that kind of gross beige that nobody likes but other than that I can recommend this restroom to anyone needing a quiet getaway from the rigors of life.

I was working at the pumpkin drop for context. 


Before pumpkins started dropping, we got everyone together and showed them the proper way to drop them: arms all the way out, lean out the building, hold it for a second, and then drop straight down. 


At some point somebody who wasn’t part of the actual drop team came up wanting to drop the pumpkin they had painted. They jumped in front of the line and didn’t hold the pumpkin out far enough, so it bounced off the Webster building and fractured sending chunks into the crowd. I know for sure two children got hit by chunks. One injured their arm, I am unaware if it was broken or bruised but they didn’t have a cast on when they left the ambulance. 


Police and paramedics were called, both children who got hit walked away from the ambulance.

q9pn1t,"The implication of the Stanford game, Rolovich, and ongoing drama.","As you and others are aware of the current circumstances in regards to Rolovich and to COVID-19 Vaccine. Here are a few outcomes to expect.

- WSU wins, Rolovich gets his exemption.

This would die down the drama a bit, but would give the anti vax people momentum and use Rolovich as a hero like persona.

-WSU loses, Rolovich doesn’t get his exemption. Fired.

This would place a complete end to the main focus of the team, since he would leave with a losing record for this season. Thus his support won’t be as great, compared to if had won.

-WSU loses, Rolovich gets his exemption. 

This would probably be the most tamed of the options. Since this would shift the focus from his Vaccine exemption, and more towards his performance as a coach. Can this get fired at the end of the season if the team ends with a losing record.

-WSU wins, Rolovich doesn’t get his exemption. Fired.

This would cause a huge windstorm of anti vax people attacking WSU in general and causing an unpleasant environment for all the WSU campuses. A lot of work will be needed by the WSU administration to keep things under control and prevent any intimidation or violence from happening on WSU campuses.

As any current student or campus gym fan knows, all Urec gyms and facilities require masks now, after not requiring them temporarily for Vaccinated patrons this past summer. I worked for urec up until spring 2021 and I want to put this out there so there can be some sort of understanding between current staff members and the wsu students or patrons of all the facilities (Chinook, Stephenson, SRC). Basically this semester, you HAVE to wear a mask in the facility at all times. However, you will NOT be questioned or kicked out if the mask is not covering your nose or mouth. I know, it defeats the purpose of the mask mandate from Gov. Inslee. None of the employees are happy about it. We enforce it this way because over the last year we have had several incident where some ""pAtRiOt"" decides to fight (verbally and sometimes physically) with staff members who ask them to pull their mask up or put one on. We understand its annoying to work out with a mask. I lifted often at the Chinook and I wasn't a fan of it, but i still complied. The enforcement rule came directly from the UREC directors since they've been aware of how badly received the mandate was from July 2020-May 2021. None of the student staff working has a choice in enforcement. If they don't follow those rules regarding enforcement they risk a negative write-up or other forms of reprimanding.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/qbt7zh/a_brief_explanation_fo_urecs_mask_policy/,sleeplessinpullman,1,2021-10-20 00:52:02,0,/r/wsu/comments/qbt7zh/a_brief_explanation_fo_urecs_mask_policy/

The amount of students not wearing masks - completely or properly - WHILE getting food or waiting in line for the cashier is getting so bad.  All of you should have one by now, but if you forget yours PLEASE ASK FOR ONE — or have a friend ask for one — FROM A CASHIER!  *We try to keep a package of them at every check out point.*


That’s not the point of my post here. This post is directed at those of you who visibly have them. I see your masks on your chins or necks.  You KNOW the rules.

*Yes,* some of you decide to use FaceID to log into the GetFood app, but that’s not an issue as long as you put your mask back on. 

*Yes,* some masks don’t always cover your whole face the way it should, but you can get one that fits better. 

**NO,** you cannot use asthma as an excuse to not cover your nose, or to pull &amp; keep your mask AWAY from your face.  *I have asthma* and it won’t kill you to wear a mask. If you have a hard time breathing, go outside and take a few deep breaths or use your inhaler, then go back in WITH A MASK. 

**YES,** it IS rude/inconsiderate to COUGH or SNEEZE WITHOUT a mask while in the Dining Hall or any other building on campus - the rules are the same everywhere.  But really, we don’t want your cold germs, Strep throat, and saliva all over the fruit station. 


I ask people to put their masks on, make gestures to the nose, and give warnings *once every five customers* these days.  And it’s not just because I think we should all wear masks to protect ourselves and each other….

THE STATE &amp; the SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION is encouraging - and some Dining Hall Managers REQUIRING - dining hall employees to REPORT YOU. 

YES. Report you.  
It goes on your record. And if you are doing it often, you will be fined or worse, *like banned from all dining halls.*   Don’t respond to our requests to wear one, and the punishment is going to be worse.  It has almost as much weight as stealing $50+ of food (and don’t get me started on that…).

A gentle glow emanated from the far end of the restroom.  It was a window, looking down upon the campus and the rolling hills of the Palouse.

I had climbed to the top of the Ivory Tower, an imposter amongst lords.  I place myself upon the Ivory Throne, a traditionally private and isolated place, but the vanity of the Ivory Lords knows no bounds.  I looked down upon the Masses, upon the kingdom of the Ivory Lords, and none of them looked up.  None had need to, for they did not know they were being judged from atop the great Tower, from the seat of the Ivory Throne.  

I pondered, for I did not come here without reason.  The Throne was secluded, there was no one to see or be heard within the room or in the halls without.  This place is without life.  

I pondered.  

There was a gap in the door, lining up directly with the the Throne.  The far reaching gaze of Judgement is not intended to be limited to those beyond the tower.

I pondered.

I wash my hands, the sink is a real sink, not one of the low-flow high-pressure monsters given to the Masses below.

I pondered.

I make my way down the steps, this secret place fading away with my footsteps, the sounds of the Masses below growing louder.  They do not know the great secret of the Ivory Tower.

The inclusive restrooms in the basement of Chinook are a very solid choice for business but sometimes they can be a little... rough.  95% of the time they are pristine but it is the 5% of the time that makes me take off a point.  Sometimes someone before you absolutely trashed a unit and there is no way to tell until you've opened the door.  Accessibility gets a solid 2 because despite it's high usage, not once have I accidentally tried to enter an occupied unit.  Traffic gets a 2 as well because each unit is separated from the outside, ensuring maximum privacy and isolation from others.  Comfort only gets a 1 because, at least in my opinion, they can be a bit claustrophobic at times.  They are a clean white with good lighting so visual appeal gets a 2.  The sinks are pretty average.  There is no temperature control and the water is lukewarm, but at least most won't splash you with pressure washer-like jets.

The restroom I used was clean and empty, and not once did someone else come in.  There is even a lock on the door if you are feeling like you need guaranteed privacy.  My one complaint, and the reason this restroom has a fat zero on the comfort score, is that the automatic  sensor would flush every time I tried to wipe, splashing my balls with ice cold toilet water.  And when I was done?  Nothing.  I had to manually flush that fucker.  Ending on a positive note the white and green tiles on the walls looked nice, so that's a solid 2.  The sink is also a plain automated unit with cool, but not cold water.

I'm working to setup a food giveaway on the day before Thanksgiving (11/24) in Reaney Park. No questions asked, if you need some assistance or you're a student stuck in town alone over break and just want some fixings for a Thanksgiving style meal, please come by. The goal of this event is to give people who need a hand a hand, and that's it. No meetings to attend, no signups. Nothing.  
  
More details will come in the coming weeks on exact time and location.  
  
Our goal is to give out premade packs of shelf stable Thanksgiving style foods that are easy to prepare for Thanksgiving to brighten people's days. Any food we do not give out will be donated directly to local food banks when the event is over.  
  
If you'd like to make any form of donation of food or time please reach out to me via direct message here, or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CardShark_). Please do not use the Reddit ""Chat"" feature as I often miss those. If you are a business who would like to donate in exchange for displaying any signage, etc., please reach out to me to discuss. If you are a business or person who would like to donate *prepared* food please also reach out to me so we can discuss the logistics of it.  
  
The goal of this is to give a hand to those people who sometimes are afraid to ask or feel guilty turning to the shelter or religious groups in their time of need. I have the ability to give back some this year and I'm trying to take advantage of it.  
  
Also, while the holidays do drive people to volunteer and donate at a higher rate, food insecurity and hunger are 365 day a year issues. If you would feel more comfortable donating directly to a local food bank or shelter please do so!

qkapow,Free Mock Interview Simulator,"Over the past few months I’ve been trying to build a mock interview simulator ([www.preparo.net](http://www.preparo.net/)).

It tries to mimic an interview being done virtually.

The reason I built it is when I was preparing for my graduate interviews in tech companies I absolutely fumbled my way through the first ten interviews before I finally actually got a job and I put a lot of it down to being quite stressed and filled with nerves because I just wasn't properly prepared for it.

I lost out on a significant amount of time working and salaries due to not being good at interviews. I wanted to fix that by building an online interview prep system.

I’ve loaded in over 20,000 random interview questions from industry experts and you can select to do interviews by competency, behavioural or randomly. You can also load in your own questions you anticipate might come up.

**It’s totally free all I ask for is feedback and suggestions!**

If this is something you’d be interested in please check it out.

Thanks a million and best of luck in your interviews.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/qkapow/free_mock_interview_simulator/,YewTewbs,1,2021-11-01 06:04:31,1,/r/wsu/comments/qkapow/free_mock_interview_simulator/

Dana Hall Basement/FIZ, 8/10

Cleanliness: 2/2

Accessibility: 2/2

Traffic: 2/2

Comfort: 0/2

Visual Appeal: 2/2

This restroom has been a popular request and I have finally had a  chance to review it.  I can see why it is so popular; it was practically spotless and not a single person besides me was around.  I had to take both points away from comfort because for whatever reason that restroom was at least 20 degrees hotter than the rest of the building and the sink... the fucking sink.  You know how 99% of the sinks on the planet are intended to aim downward?  Well this sink is part of the 1% that aims AT you.  You won't get sprayed directly but as soon as you stick your hands in the stream you will get wet.  Visually it is a very tall room with a not-dirty brown as a primary color, lighting is poor for the far stalls but it's good enough to make do.  It should also be noted that this restroom does not have a handicap stall if you are in need of one.

qqsp2n,"Questions related to CS/MIS/ECON/Finance majors, and school choices.","Hi guys, I am currently deciding which program to transfer to, and to which school. The school choices are basically WSU or UW since I want most if not all of my credits at CC to get counted. I got a 4.0 in every class I took at CC so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a few questions about the CS, MIS, ECON, and Finance majors at WSU. Would like to know more about these majors from current students' perspectives, or anyone who graduated within the last four years. I'm also curious about what do the global campus students have to say about MIS/ECON majors. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions for CS major students:

1) What is the ideal GPA to get into the program?

2) Is it easy to get internships? What are the job prospects after graduation?  

Lastly, are there any CS students who transferred from UW(any campus) to WSU? How competitive was it at UW? 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions for MIS/Econ/Finance majors students: 

1) What is the ideal GPA to get into the program?

2) Would you say the curriculum is nicely constructed to teach you the necessary skills needed in this field? 

3) How much math is involved in your major? 

4) Is it easy to get internships? What are the job prospects after graduation?  

Lastly, for those of you who majored in MIS at WSU, what would you say about the Business Administration with a concentration in MIS at UW Bothell campus. Which one do you think it's better and why? 

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who transferred from UW to WSU, apart from the friendly community feeling here at WSU, what else do you like the most?

qsnhyu,Update: Thanksgiving Meals Giveaway and Food Drive (11/24/21 in Reaney Park) - Come by for Free Pizza w/ Food Donations as Well!,"Hey all!  
  
Rob here, the person running the meal giveaway and food drive on the 24th in Reaney Park ([previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/qiq71s/cougs_i_am_setting_up_a_food_giveaway_for_the_day/)). I've got some updates to share and details to fill in for people who were looking to participate or help out in any way.  
  
We've made some good strides since the last post, so I wanted to share some updates. First and foremost we've been able to work with our local [Domino's Pizza](https://www.dominos.com/) in Pullman as well as [The Land](https://www.thelandpullman.com/) to make some improvements.  
  
We'll have the Gazebo at [Reaney Park](https://goo.gl/maps/G8jrCxKXtrcEGhzL7) for the afternoon of the 24th, we plan on being ""open"" from 12 (noon) to roughly 7 that day. During that time we'll be giving out food but also ***hosting a food drive*** during that time. We will have **FREE DOMINO'S PIZZA** for any donations and donations of non perishable goods (canned, dry, shelf stable foods) will be split among those at the event seeking food if we run out with all the remainder (and any of our meal kits remaining) going to the [WSU System Food Pantry](https://deanofstudents.wsu.edu/wsu-system-food-pantries/) (Pullman Campus) to continue to help students and community members in need after Thanksgiving.  
  
Secondly, we're putting together roughly 25 bags (trying to get this number up, hoping to do so in the next few days) which are meal kits for people who need some help this year or students stuck in town over the holiday break who want something that feels like a Thanksgiving meal. Items are easy to prepare and shelf stable, the meal can be done in a microwave but an oven always helps. They currently include:  
  
- Green Beans  
- Corn  
- Stove Top Stuffing  
- Mashed Potatoes  
- Gravy Mix  
- Snack Packs (I'm also currently working to improve the desert, logistics issue on my first plan)  
- A coupon for a Free Domino's Medium 2-Topping Pizza  
  
Thanks to a donation from a Redditor (/u/flowers_for_taco) we were also able to turn their donation straight into protein and work out some details with a local restaurant for that. We'll be purchasing Chicken Strips from [The Land](https://www.thelandpullman.com/) to include with every meal as well. To keep these as fresh as possible they will likely arrive in two waves, early and late afternoon, to be added to the bags. We landed on chicken strips for a few reasons:  
  
- The Land's fried chicken is delicious  
- It's hard to get Turkey in any meaningful way, let alone in bulk, without a lot more hoops  
- The chicken strips should hold and reheat well  
- The Land was willing to work with us to help out here  
  
Over the next two weeks I'll be trying to add a few more items to help round the kits out (plates for those who need them, rolls hopefully, some can openers if people need those as well) and then finalize the logistics of the giveaway.  
  
Again, this is ***no questions asked, no requirements of you*** - no meetings, no church groups, no signups, if you need help or just feel stuck in town and can't get home for break come by for some comfort food. If we do run out of food that day I'm working on potential backups, it's our hope that we don't and I'll try my best to make something happen.  
  
If you are in town and can spare some non-expired items for the food drive as well please come by and grab a slice of pizza. You can also donate personal hygiene items which will help out other fellow Cougs.  
  
If you'd like to donate specifically to the food drive for the meal kits, or donate any time or service for the day of, please reach out to me via Reddit DM (or comment below how you can be reached).  
  
Thank you, and Go Cougs!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/qsnhyu/update_thanksgiving_meals_giveaway_and_food_drive/,cougrrr,1,2021-11-12 18:13:30,0,/r/wsu/comments/qsnhyu/update_thanksgiving_meals_giveaway_and_food_drive/

qtbqoj,Why can't we order specific sports games to stream online?,"Do any of you know if we can order specific sports games to stream online? If not, why can't we buy a game or even a season of WSU sports games to stream online for a fee? I mean if WSU sells in person tickets, it seems like they could sell streaming tickets (for cheaper of course). 

Why can you order boxing matches or MMA fights as a pay-per-view, but not other sports? I assume this probably has something to do with networks and streaming rights and whatnot, but it seems that even ESPN or the Pac 12 Network could do this. 

It also seems like WSU could use the pandemic as a way to circumvent any network rights, because they could just say they are offering it to ensure the safety of the fans and students, and still make revenue while there is a global pandemic. I'm sure they don't want infected people in the stadiums. 

If anyone could explain why either networks or schools don't offer pay-per-view or on-demand for games, that would helpful, links to information or articles about it would be greatly appreciated.

qukpsf,Waitlist question!,"So despite me being a third year, I’ve never been on a waitlist for a class before. For this coming semester, I have two classes which are only offered spring and only have one section. I made it on the waitlist for both of these classes. One of them I am in 3rd position, the other 10th. 
Im wondering, for people who have been on the waitlist before, how likely it is for me to make it into the classes. I’d plan on showing up to these classes during the first couple weeks despite if I’m still on the waitlist, but these classes are pretty important and I can’t really risk having to graduate late as they are fall prerequisite courses.

r07s4l,Dorm Help?,"Hello! ^_^ I have been accepted into WSU Pullman and I am planning to commit and attend as a freshman in Fall 2022. 

WSU is quite far from my house (about a 5 hour drive) and there’s no doubt I’m going to be living in the dorms haha. I am having some trouble deciding on which hall to sign up for. It would be great to have some help and suggestions! (Or perhaps I look into apartments?)

- I am open to having a dorm mate
- Would prefer female-only hall more (Coed is okay!) 
- My area of interests is science, engineering, and arts. 
- Closer to the main campus 
- I don’t know how to drive yet so I want a comfy and quick way to get to campus 

(I don’t know if the last two really adds to anything lol)

r0sg8b,Food Drive / Meal Giveaway - Tomorrow in Reaney Park (Noon to Six)! Food drive donations get free pizza!,"All,

Last update, and sorry for the three post spam, just wanted to give out a reminder. We're handing out Thanksgiving meals and pizza tomorrow in Reaney Park at the Gazebo from noon until 6pm.  
  
We've put together 25 Thanksgiving inspired meal kits with shelf stable foods and some extras that are easy to prepare for those that need some help this year; whether you're in town and unable to get home to see your family or you need some help due to the fact it's been a rough few years for a lot of people come by and grab some food.  
  
The kit we prepared is as follows:  
- Chicken Strips (delivered and a big thanks to [The Land](https://www.thelandpullman.com/))  
- Free Medium Pizza Coupon (just a bonus thanks to our local Pullman Domino's)  
- Green Beans  
- Corn  
- Mashed Potatoes  
- Gravy Mix  
- Stuffing  
- Snack Packs  
- Cocoa Mix  
- Hot Cider Mix  
- Bottle of Sparkling Cider  
- Mini Pumpkin Pies  
  
If you need a bag, come by and grab one. No questions asked. No meetings to attend. Just enjoy. I'll try to keep this post updated with current stock.  
  
We're also trying to draw in non-perishable food donations for the [WSU Food Pantry](https://deanofstudents.wsu.edu/wsu-system-food-pantries/) and all donations will get some free Domino's Pizza. If we do run low on the meal kit bags we'll also try to put some meals together using the donated items (we have some extra items as well), we'll try our best not to turn anyone away.  
  
I know many have left for break already, but if you're in town and would like to donate a few cans of food please come by to help our fellow Cougs throughout the year and get some free Pizza for your efforts!  
  
Thanks a ton, and Go Cougs!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/r0sg8b/food_drive_meal_giveaway_tomorrow_in_reaney_park/,cougrrr,1,2021-11-23 20:08:44,1,/r/wsu/comments/r0sg8b/food_drive_meal_giveaway_tomorrow_in_reaney_park/

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/WSU) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in, as well as filter courses by department and level and compare these courses. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking and know what to expect.

Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add.

Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.

Enjoy!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/r87dsb/i_made_ratemyprofessors_but_for_classes_rate_my/,oopsidaisiess,1,2021-12-03 14:45:01,10,/r/wsu/comments/r87dsb/i_made_ratemyprofessors_but_for_classes_rate_my/
r8fkql,I'm transferring from UW Seattle to WSU Pullman as a Junior.,"After a lot of thought I've decided to transfer out of UW's Engineering department and into WSU's Engineering department. I went to UW Seattle as a transfer student out of Tacoma Community College admittedly for the prestige and career opportunities that Seattle had to offer.   However, I deeply regreted my decision. I have never been so depressed in my entire life.  UW's faculty are not what I expected. The professors focus heavily on reasurch and very little on undergrad students learning.  They are never available for office hours.  Some said they don't even know what their office hours are because they do not go to them.  When they do show up to their office hours there is about two dozen students at their door with questions about homework. I started asking myself.  Is this the best learning environment?  Every professor and faculty member says this is a prestigious institution.  What's the point of attending a prestigious school if you can't even ask the professor about a question on the HW.  The TA's are no better.  Most say their busy with their own HW or grading exams and can't meet today.  The professors also do not care if you do poorly. A  D- is a passing grade in UW's Engineering program.  

I feel like as a student I would perform better at a school like WSU with grade minimums like a C or better.  It shows the professor's would need to care at least a bit more then UW.  Not to mention none of my exams at UW have ever been curved.  Maybe WSU also avoids curves.  Let me know what you think.

ragid6,Winter is upon us! Here are my tips,"**Campus Traffic**

- Pedestrians: Be extra careful. Cars will have trouble operating in slippery conditions. If you're slipping, they are too. Vehicles may have difficulty stopping on a downhill, or getting going again on an uphill. Remember to look both ways!

- Cars: your stopping distance is longer than you think. Roads that may have been fine can turn to ice without warning. Leave space, go slow, get there in one piece. Be extra careful with crosswalks - pedestrians can slip and fall. Don't assume they'll be out of the way by the time you get there.

**Walking**

- Keep your ears and fingers warm. Ears in particular are going to be the first things to start hurting when it gets chilly!

- 2 pairs of socks are great for keeping your toes warm. 

- If you want to avoid slipping and sliding, take a large pair of socks and wear them over-top of your shoes: like a glove. Makes walking on ice feel like dry pavement

- There are some good sled hills on the rogers-orton playfield on the south side, and on spokane steet by goertzen

- Keep those phones and earbuds charged - batteries don't last long in the cold!

**Driving**

- All season tires aren't snow tires

- Be careful of de-icer. As the weather gets cooler, the de-iced areas will freeze into a skating-rink at night

- Clear the snow off of your *whole* car, not just the windshield. Buildup on the roof can dislodge while driving and become a hazard to other drivers

- If you're sideways, focus on getting yourself straight again before you hit the brakes (practice in a parking lot)

- If you can't get control, look where you want to go - aim somewhere soft like a snow bank or bushes.

- If you're sliding, fresh show has more grip than old. Offset yourself in the lane. Otherwise, eat a curb. Either will get you to a stop

- One person on a hill at a time. If you're going uphill and the person in front starts sliding backwards, you have nowhere to go. Likewise, if you're going downhill and the person in front stops and you can't, then you'll be sad

- Avoid stopping on an uphill whenever possible. It can be difficult to start going again!

- ABS won't stop you from spinning out. And 4x4 won't help you stop. Just because you can get going fast doesn't mean you'll be able to stop moving quite as easily. Take it slow and easy!

- Glide through turns, don't hit the gas - less apt to spin out

- Go find an empty parking lot and practice losing, then re-gaining control. The best skills come from experience!

- Pullman-moscow highway is a hellscape and is some of the slipperiest black-ice I've ever driven on. If you travel this regularly, *get studded tires*",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/ragid6/winter_is_upon_us_here_are_my_tips/,SnowDrifter_,1,2021-12-06 15:13:15,19,/r/wsu/comments/ragid6/winter_is_upon_us_here_are_my_tips/

rdm9ok,Notification of Increased Cases of Influenza and Student Accommodations,"I got this email today, and I can't find any external links to the statement so I'm just copy&amp;pasting it here. Figure it's worth getting out there so people can better advocate for themselves if needed.

&gt;Dear WSU Pullman Faculty,

 

&gt;Over the last several days, we have been made aware of a significant increase in Influenza A cases in Whitman County.  With finals week quickly approaching, we wanted to take the opportunity to remind you to exercise understanding and generosity in responding to students’ requests to keep up with the coursework or make up missed work due to illness. I am asking you to please reasonably accommodate students who are absent due to illness. 

 

&gt;A reminder that faculty cannot ask for documentation of medical/health conditions.  Students who are temporarily ill do not need official accommodations from the Access Center or approval to take a make-up exam. In each syllabus, make-up exam policies should have been clearly communicated, and those documented procedures should be adhered to.

 

&gt;Finally, per Academic Regulation 90h, faculty are permitted to issue an incomplete grade which is a term used to indicate that a grade has been deferred.  Additional information regarding the incomplete grade is provided below for your convenience.

 

&gt;90h. (Incomplete) It is for students who for reasons beyond their control are unable to complete their work on time. All outstanding incomplete work (including grades of I, X, and blank/no grade) must be completed and posted to the official transcript prior to the conferral of the degree. It is strongly recommended that students who are granted an Incomplete limit their total number of credits to 18 credits (including credits for the Incomplete course and any new courses) during the semester when they are finishing an Incomplete.  Students who receive an I grade have up to the end of the ensuing year to complete the course, unless a shorter interval is specified by the instructor. If the incomplete is not made up during the specified time or the student repeats the course, the I is changed to an F.  Instructors are required to submit an Incomplete Grade Report (IGR) to the departmental office with every I given. The IGR must specify conditions and requirements for completing the incomplete, as well as any time limitations less than one year.

 

&gt;If you have any questions about the above reminder and Academic Regulation, you are welcome to contact Bill Davis, Interim Vice Provost for Academic Engagement and Student Achievement (wbdavis@wsu.edu).

 

&gt;Thank you again for your flexibility and commitment to our students.

 

&gt;Sincerely,

It has recently come to my attention that when a user is banned from the unofficial WSU discord server, they are IP banned. This would not be an issue, except for the fact that many students live in dorms or apartments where they may share the same IP as a banned user. If this has happened to you, please direct message me your discord name and I can help you fix the problem. I'm not sure where else to spread this information so I thought the reddit would be the best way to reach out to students. 

I've contacted Discord regarding this issue and have found a temporary solution for now. The below link is a valid invite link, so if it does not work, please comment on this thread or DM me so I can get you in!

rk2g1p,"Never skied before, how to start","Hi all,

Skiing season is already here, I’m interested in skiing but have no experience in it, hope to have some help with my questions.

Transportation: I have a civic sedan with snow tires and chains, will I be fine driving up and down the mountains. Also has anyone used the UREC’s ski shuttle? It seems that they leave Pullman by 6AM and leave silver mountain by 6PM, the cost is $30. Would it be a waste doing a one-day trip? The cost if I drive will probably $26. I also wonder if the skiing equipment will fit in my civic or that I will have to put down the rear seats which means I can only have one passenger with me.

Accommodation: Do people usually live at the resort, or do they live at hotels nearby. I checked the rooms at silver mountain resort and it seems that all room during the weekend on January are already full and when I searched for the Studio rooms during weekdays it’s $201/day.

Equipment: I will probably rent for the first and maybe the second trip, should I rent from UREC or at the ski resort. From my research on the internet, it seems that if I do ski regularly, it would be cheaper to buy my own equipment? 

Training: Seems that UREC doesn’t offer any skiing lessons, should I go for the lessons at the ski resort or simply having some friends that know how to ski will work? Which lessons are recommended.

Pass &amp; Location: Do students usually buy the Lookout pass and silver mountain pass at UREC? Which resort is recommended?

Also if anyone is looking into/planning on skiing, please feel free to contact me, I am willing to drive or share gas &amp; other expenses for the trip and make friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/rk2g1p/never_skied_before_how_to_start/,shadowpriest_r,1,2021-12-19 13:22:53,0,/r/wsu/comments/rk2g1p/never_skied_before_how_to_start/

rl1wul,Can I hope to study at WSU?,"- I am from an extremely poor family. I applied to the following schools and here are the outcomes. First the rejects, then the acceptances.

- I was rejected by my safety school - Bemidji State University.

- I was born and raised in Washington state and have never been outside the US. Whitman College kept asking for my TOEFL score because my US address has xxx Mexico Ave, Apt xxx. My many e-mails to Whitman College were fruitless because they kept sending me application incomplete notice for want of a TOEFL score. 

- The College of William &amp; Mary sent me a reject ""because other students had better academic performance than you"" and encouraged me to apply after my ""academic performance improves"". I asked them how I can possibly improve upon a 4.0 GPA. They never replied.

- I was accepted by University of Washington and Stanford on the West Coast. On the East Coast, I was accepted by Rochester, Yale, MIT and Princeton. I could have started at any of these schools in Fall 2021.

- The ""poor students attend free promise"" by such elite schools are a lie. At least they are 99% lies with maybe a 1% grain of truth in them. I did not get a penny of funding from any of these schools, so I could not join any of them.

- After leaving Washington, my family moved around. I realized that I am not a resident of any state now. I am probably a resident of Minnesota now but not counted as a resident for tuition purposes.

- My father is in gambling loans, so he refused to allow me to apply for FAFSA. As a result, I am still sitting here at home instead of attending school despite acceptances by good schools.

- Instead of applying to brand name schools for 2022, I plan to apply to schools with two parameters: low tuition and low cost of living. So no applying to University of Washington, for example, because Seattle is an expensive city to live.

- Pullman has a relatively low cost of living. So WSU fits one parameter. Now is there any way I can go to WSU for free? If not, I will have to explore geoarbitrage - take advantage of lower costs in a country like Madagascar and go to college in some such country where there's a dollar conversion advantage.

rtevcn,PSA Snow and Weather Conditions,"This is a little PSA for new incoming students or those who have not been to WSU during winter months. The road conditions coming to and going from Pullman become very dangerous so please plan accordingly. For people who haven't been to Pullman long enough to see the winter conditions, you should be careful. No matter your driving skill, it's dangerous.

My first year coming back after Winter break I had a friend drive me and we spun out and were stuck in a snowbank for a few minutes. And there were around 20 or so other drivers who also had this issue. 

During the winter the snow is so thick you will have trouble driving here if you aren't being cautious. On top of that, if it is snowing the day you are coming over, you will likely have extremely low visibility. I know many of you might want to get here quickly so you get out of the snow faster. DON'T. It is not safer to be fast when the conditions are the way they are in Eastern Washington. 

Take it slow. Be mindful of the others coming to Pullman. And remember to drive safely. If you have to stop, pump your brakes slowly. Be safe out there guys, there have been some areas I've seen where the snow hasn't been plowed and almost reaches a foot or more. And most importantly, check weather conditions.

There's numerous public cams online that show the major roadways leading to Pullman where you can see the safest route.

rvnd5x,New snow drivers (or just anyone},"The roads are slick in Pullman. Doesn't matter if you're running an f350 in 4x4 or a Subaru with studded tires, you are going to slip. 

The weather is cold enough and the snow is wet enough it will cake and freeze to your tires making some really fun drift wheels. 

HOWEVER this is the issue I've come to talk about today...no... It's turn signs and braking. 


I work on campus and have been here all break. If you are going down a hill.. say stadium...and you are turning to go into Starbucks or up Monroe, put your blinker on and start showing brake lights sooner than usual. 

You may be stopped, but the people behind you might not be stopping before entering your backseat. 

As the old saying says. You might have 4 wheel drive but you don't have 4 wheel brake. 

If you brake late, your sedan will become a subcompact real quick. 

If you try to turn to beat a coming car,.either you'll get thin, or the other car will be stuck sliding down a hill.

rzkwon,Should you tell your roommate if you are behind on rent?,"My roommate didn’t pay rent for two months and never told me, I had to find out from our apartment management. My roommate acted like it wasn’t my business, I told her that since both our names are on the lease and we’re equally responsible for rent, I feel like it is my business cause if she doesn’t pay then it fall onto me. Then she didn’t pay her utilities bill and also didn’t tell me about that, I asked her nicely to tell me if she’ll being paying late in the future but she never responded to that text. And then when I asked when she’s gonna be able to pay it she refused to tell me when she’s getting payed. 

It’s just so frustrating and stressful to deal with and I can’t really “mind my business” since my name is on the lease and I don’t want this affecting my ability to get a future apartment of affecting my credit. The worst part is we were friends before this and she just didn’t tell me.

s0i32l,College days can be depressing,"I had a back to back failure in exams and had to repeat years. I was depressed and was thinking if I choose the correct stream.

&amp;#x200B;

Was driven into loneliness and didn't have the daring to meet anyone new. Was afraid to meet my relatives or old friends, as they would ask about my current life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Was stuck with past failure thoughts and guilt feelings, anger towards myself as to why I cat get control over. The internet was a safe pocket to hide. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was introduced to Sahaja meditation. And it helped during each depressing time. It gave a new meaning and purpose to start over. Every failure didn't bring me down completely. Now I can say that throughout my teen days and struggling depressive days meditation helped, as we start knowing ourselves. What is good and bad for us, we see rather than listen to others.  

&amp;#x200B;

I completed my engg. and started my own little web development company. Life still gives us ups and downs. But a shy and introvert like me can now be a stream leader in an MNC is big. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I wish all the students out there who face struggle, hard times or questions over their career paths,  just know life has a meaning to each one of us. Some know it early, and some know it easily. But those who struggle to find the purpose really know the value. Love yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Do they only want hookups, is it hard to find a girl who wants to commit? Also, I heard parties are great place to find your partner and make friends. Also heard that most of them thrown by frat boys and they don’t let you in unless you’re in one.

While I normally do not complain about things related to WSU, I have no choice but to post this. I have tested positive for COVID-19 and as a result I have been moved to a quarantine dorm. I will attach a link where you can see pictures of everything I am talking about. Immediately after walking in, I noticed that there is a large amount of dirt dust and drywall on the floor. The room looks like it hasn’t been cleaned since 2020. There are nut stains or god knows what type of stain on the mattress, and the bathroom is even worse. When I walked into the bathroom there was SHIT still in the toilet! (Not pictured). Literally someone’s log cabin was left over in the private bathroom accompanying my quarantine room. I went into the shower and it is nastier than my dorm showers, which are all shared by a floor of about 20-30 dudes. There is snot residue caking the inside of he bathroom from the previous resident. If a bathroom is worse than my dorm’s bathroom, then I know there is a problem. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of cleanliness in the provided quarantine room. I wasn’t expecting any level of luxury but this room is atrocious and as a result I will be heading back home on the west side to quarantine. It’s hard to get nastier than a dorm room shared bathroom or a frat bathroom, but the provided quarantine rooms at wsu have managed to do so.

I’m broke from not working during break so I don’t really have the cash to pay her half so I’ll have to take it out of my savings (which I can only do a limited amount of times), and then I’m gonna be out that money till I get payed back.

Is it even worth saying anything to her? I feel like I am a good conversationalist but my biggest problem is that I have such a hard time starting it like going up and be like “Hey I’m so and so”.

Another reason why I’m so nervous is because she sits at a different lab table and her lab partner appears to be her best friend. Idk why but this makes it more intimidating.

sfq5y5,Join WSU's BattleBots Team!,"Good afternoon Cougs!  

WSU's very own BattleBots team is look to recruit undergraduate students from all majors and disciplines to join the team! You do not need any prior experience to join. As long as you're open to learning and doing things for the team, you are more than welcome to join. Our main method of communication is over discord to notify others about meeting times and design progress. Feel free to join at the link: [https://discord.gg/fvb6xWvJBn](https://discord.gg/fvb6xWvJBn)  

In case you are not familiar with BattleBots, it is a combat robot television series that is broadcasted nationwide with a huge following. Two robots are thrown into an arena with pulverizers, spike strips, and kill saws in addition to the many potential weapons on each robot. There are lots of clips of the show on YouTube to watch if you are interested in seeing the type of robots we could be fighting against. We were accepted onto the show in 2020, but COVID delayed the recording of the show, and we were unable to get into our work room due to early pandemic protocols. Now that WSU is fully in person again, we have picked up where the team has left off, building and modifying the two and a half existing robots.   

We currently meet in Dana 216 on Saturdays at 10:00am. Our Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering/Computer Science, and Business sub-teams meet at different times during the week but that information can be found at the discord link posted above.  

We have a lot of work to do before our first potential BattleBots appearance and excited to bring anyone onto the team that are interested in helping in any way!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/sfq5y5/join_wsus_battlebots_team/,Crimson_Robotics_WSU,1,2022-01-29 14:54:00,0,/r/wsu/comments/sfq5y5/join_wsus_battlebots_team/

skdu43,Medical Withdraw Petition?,"Hi. Has anyone done medical withdraw petition to dean? I failed the last semester (last semester was my first semester at WSU as a transfer student). I had doctor's appointments all the time (specialists like cardiologist, rheumatologist etc). So I had to fly to Seattle a lot. (Unfortunately there are no specialists in Pullman or near here.) I was unable to attend the classes a lot, so I failed the classes. I got academic prohibition after that. And they also dropped my major because of it. It is unfair. But I did not know I could submit medical withdraw petition and get W on all classes for last semester. Also if I do that, I can be my major back too. My advisor just told me. She said I can still submit. 

Has anyone done this before? How was the process? I saw people who did due to mental issues. But I wonder if anyone has done due to physical chronic illness issues. 

I already have the diagnosis of doctor's note (cardiovascular disease), cardiovascular medicine prescription, doctor visit history, medical bill, visit summary, medical test and test results that I did last semester. Also I got covid vaccine exemption doctor's note as well (medical reason). So maybe that also supports that I already have some medical issue right?

Also the reason I had to visit doctors a lot in Seattle was.. my symptoms got very worse.  I already have cardiovascular disease. And the doctors were suspecting I also have autoimmune inflammatory disease, some neurological problems, and some immune system issues additionally. So I had to see multiple doctors to figure out what was wrong. Is it reasonable to submit the petition? The academic advisor recommended me to submit it. But I am wondering if it is really reasonable reason.

slqrmr,How does WSU manage visitors for Graduation?,"Sorry for the awkward title; it’s late and I’m not sure how to word my question. 

My future in-laws, their daughter, and her husband want to come to see me graduate - they live out of state - and I am worried that they will limit the number of people they’ll allow each graduate to bring. My fiancé’s sister was forced to only bring a maximum of 3 people to her graduation, and her school kept track with tickets. Anyone who brought more than 4 was penalized and turned away. 

My mom booked a hotel for herself and my uncle and aunt last month for spring graduation weekend, and the closest they could get is Lewiston.  So if my in laws are going to be allowed to come they need to make reservations **now.**  However, there is no information posted yet on WSU’s graduation/commencement page and I have no idea how they do graduation ceremonies here. 

Do they limit the number of people you can bring? Do they use tickets, and if so how expensive are they?  Any advise? 

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/slqrmr/how_does_wsu_manage_visitors_for_graduation/,Mooing_Mermaid,1,2022-02-06 02:14:31,0,/r/wsu/comments/slqrmr/how_does_wsu_manage_visitors_for_graduation/

smgw96,Free internship resource for students!," Hey Cougs! I wanted to share a free resource called RippleMatch, and it could potentially ease your recruiting process. O*n RippleMatch, you have a feed of opportunities curated just for you, kind of like TikTok. You don’t have to scroll through thousands of opportunities like you do with job boards; instead, you can generate your own matches that the AI finds for you. It is made specifically for college students!  I enjoy it because it takes under five minutes to apply to each company and get your profile in front of a recruiter—and you’ll actually hear back rather than getting ghosted by job boards. You’ll also have a 50% chance of getting an interview when you apply through RippleMatch (compared to 2% on job boards)* 

I wanted to share this resource with you all. Feel free to DM me with any questions you may have!

svz5ub,Any tips on housing/work for transfer student?,"I am currently attending WSU Everett however my housing situation isn't an option over here anymore. Housing is stupid expensive so I am going to transfer to the main campus to finish out my degree (Fall 2023 graduate). 

My current job pays pretty well for the work and is extremely flexible with school hours which is super nice. I'm kinda nervous about finding a spot over there that's flexible with school and pays decently. 

Secondly, how does housing work over there? Over here most places you want to rent from require you make 3x the rent. I don't think I'll be making that much working part time over there and will probably take out some small student loans to cover the expenses. When applying do you just let them know hey I'm only making X but I plan on taking student loans to help cover costs?

swmwkr,Survey for a class project,"Hi everyone! Hope you had a great day 😛 This survey only takes less than 5 minutes to complete!

My team is working on a class project in which we have to develop an idea for a new product/platform that solves an ongoing problem. 

We chose to develop a platform where students can join and get matched with a mentor based on their majors and interests. In exchange, they have to post reviews/materials for the classes they took or enroll in our monthly subscription. We believe this platform will help students to create life-long connections with their mentors and have a place to browse through when registering for classes. 

Details about our ideas can be found in the form! Any feedback is greatly appreciated 🙏

I have been wanting to go back to Pullman because I’ve become too comfortable at home and want to have other opportunities of living in a different city. I got to live there for my freshman year in 2019-2020 and got to have so many new experiences.
The online classes were going well for me in the beginning but now I feel like I am unmotivated and unproductive trying to work from home. I love with my dad and siblings half the week, hanging around them brings me back to old ways that I don’t like. I find myself acting immature and irritable, I don’t like it at all. It also has been very difficult trying to make friends over here (west coast). I want to grow as a person and in the environment I’m in right now isn’t helping me with that. So I had planned to move back to Pullman this next fall and study abroad next spring but my mother mentioned that it might be better to stay at home again and save money so I could move out after I graduate from college in Summer (2023).

It appears that apartment costs are a lot lower than where I'm coming from though so pretty much all of the apartments should be in my price range.

I'm 24 and have had bad experiences with roommates in the past so I want to live alone. I'm also a quiet/calm person, I don't drink, party, or engage in any rowdiness so I'd prefer a place that is at least somewhat quiet and not wild. I'd also prefer a place that has an in-unit washer and dryer. It would be nice if the apartment has utilities included or is one that is furnished, but this is not a ""must-have"" for me. I will have my car with me so I can commute although I will probably take the bus when it is icy.

I recently got accepted into UW but got rejected by their computer science program, but before the acceptance into UW i got into WSU with the hope of doing something in computer science.

And also, as I got into the school, I saw that the EFC for me was a total of 0.00, I saw what it covered but I never saw if food was the things that it covered as well.

tapvm4,Computer Science and Software Engineering,"Hello everyone, I am a foreign student (I am translating a few things) but I am planning on attending WSU sometime in the near future. I have been going to community college and am wanting to transfer here after my two years. What really got me interested in examining computer science vs software engineering is what probably has most people doing the same thing, the unholy math.

 I am not bad at math but in order for me, or anyone really to truly learn something, they have to be motivated and have at least some small interest in learning it. I know many people say ""but math IS computer science."" or ""Math teaches you logical thinking which you need for programming."" This to me is absolutely ridiculous. Should we be assigning numerous high level chemistry courses to future chefs because ""chemistry requires precise measurements and combing ingredients to obtain the proper result just like a chef does with food"". I am sorry but the reality is that 99% of the people in Computer Science are going to get programming jobs, and almost none of them will require beyond basic algebra. If they ever needed advanced math, the company will go look it up or hire an actual mathematician. Just because the two require similar thought processes doesn't mean I should be learning a ton of math I will forget as soon as I get out of school. I want to learn programming, how to work in a team, how to deliver efficient results in a working environment. Not how to find derivatives and the foci of an ellipse.

So my question is how exactly does computer science differ from software engineering in WSU? Does it require less mathematics and focus more on actually useful courses or will it be mostly the same with negligible differences? Is software engineering seen as less prestigious? Is the software engineering path as high quality as the computer science one offered at WSU?

How difficult is the process of transferring and adjusting to living there? Also is it worth transferring there if I’d only be a student at WSU for two years as opposed to the typical four.

Also I’ll be transferring in being 23 years old, which would make me older than most students. I struggled with personal issues that kept me out of school and prevented me from having the college experience. Now I feel I’m ready to go back and have a fresh start but I worry I’m too old.

tjhkei,What should all students take advantage of?,"I'm about to graduate and thought I'd share my thoughts. Feel free to include other things!

1. **UREC**. You're paying thousands of bucks for access to the UREC. It's probably one of the better gyms I've been to, it's clean, non-judgmental, has tons of equipment. The hot tub alone is pretty great after a workout. If you have access to the Chinook, sign up for classes. I wish I had tried classes way earlier in my undergrad career and gotten my form dialed in. 

2. **Planetarium**. It's like a theater but a dome. It's $5 and lasts roughly an hour. It's a great date spot if you're into science-y things and the presenter is always enthusiastic.

3. **Asking for help**. This has been said like a thousand times, but classes are so much easier when you find a study group. There's the WSU CS, Engineering, and Physics Discords, along with a billion other Discord servers out there. If you need help, don't be afraid to ask on there! There's always someone willing to help out. Prof office hours can be a great resource, but it can be hard approaching them and it's easier to talk with other students.

4. **Undergrad research**. If you're interested at all in school beyond your undergrad career, it's almost essential to do research as an undergrad. You don't need to to think of a project or anything like that, just find a prof that's doing interesting research and schedule a time to talk to them. They'll give you something to work on and you'll get paid to do it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/tjhkei/what_should_all_students_take_advantage_of/,LongSyllabus,1,2022-03-21 13:49:36,0,/r/wsu/comments/tjhkei/what_should_all_students_take_advantage_of/

tjq9be,Anyone else having issues with the payment system?,"So I got an email saying I was being charged for being late on my rent. I noticed I did get a confirmation email from the school saying I payed it. But then noticed I had no payment pulled from my bank account.

I went to the office to ask about it and apparently they said three days after I submitted my payment my “bank” kicked back that I bounced the Echeck. (Btw they never notified me my payment failed) Funny thing is my bank has no record of wsu every trying to withdraw money and I had plenty of money so it should had bounced the check anyways. So the bank basically said that wsu messed something up sending the payment over cuz they never got it.

Last month I paid my February rent and got the confirmation AND the money pulled from my bank account. Then they managed to charge me AGAIN for February and I had to sit on the phone for over an hour to get that fixed with the bursar office. So I’m pretty sure it’s not my banks fault as this is the second time in two months I’ve had payment issues.  With wsu. Also to add I have the same bank account and routing info saved in my wsu that I’ve used for the last three years. Nothing has changed. 

I’m going to talk to the bursar office again tomorrow with proof my bank never received the transaction and go from there. I just want to know is anyone else having weird issues with this new payment system they implemented? It’s getting annoying and I don’t have the time to deal with this every freaking month lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/tjq9be/anyone_else_having_issues_with_the_payment_system/,Jellohorse,1,2022-03-21 20:22:40,0,/r/wsu/comments/tjq9be/anyone_else_having_issues_with_the_payment_system/

tsdmjk,how does your financial aid award look like?,"So I got admitted for Fall 2022 as a transfer student (yay!!!!), and I got my financial aid award yesterday. 

My EFC is 0 so I got the full Pell Grant, SEOG, and Washington College Grant, and one unsubsidized loan. But my need summary states that I am $556 short for the school year ($273 per semester). Now that may not seem like much to you guys,
I just want to see what I can do to get that covered and the full Cost of Attendance (29,660 a year). Does it depend on my personal expenses? Housing, food? Etc.
Because of this I may not get a refund and won't be able to pay for off campus housing.

In summary, I want to see what your financial aid package looks like and get an idea of your full Cost of Attendance and what yours was at the end of each semester/school year. What have you've done to get your education fully covered (and perhaps get a financial aid refund?)

Especially if your EFC is 0.

i actively learn new things outside of class on my own time because i love cs but it's never the things i'm just seemingly expected to know. and it doesn't even seem to be in a rude way or anything people are just genuinely dumbfounded if i don't know something so i just pretend as if i do know (which i'm sure others are doing as well?) and either figure it out later or just don't. it makes me feel embarrassed and not as good as everyone else.

i don't have any relatives in any stem field at all, i had barely any background before coming into cs, so i get the difference there but if i'm doing extremely well in my classes and absorbing a lot of knowledge and then more so, i don't like feeling like i'm still desperately, constantly behind. i just want to know if anyone else in cs here feels the same way or has felt that way too",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/tshmc4/does_anyone_else_feel_intense_imposter_syndrome/,Dizzy-Feeling4607,1,2022-03-30 16:09:47,0,/r/wsu/comments/tshmc4/does_anyone_else_feel_intense_imposter_syndrome/

tzewtc,Heald Hall is a fucking sauna,"Heald Hall has no business being as hot as it is. I'm sweating like a passionfruit at customs. It should be called Hell Hall or Heald Hell or Hell\^2. Worst part is I have 2 classes back to back in there. I don't sweat easily but by the time class 2 ends I am more sweat than man. I've started to cover myself in pam cooking spray so I don't have to be scrapped off the chair. After 5 minutes in the first class I am a nice golden brown, and by the end of the second class I am popcorn forgotten in the microwave after you just hit the 5 button. 

As I walk up the steps to leave, ascending mt doom itself, broken and defeated by just 11AM, the light from the projector directly blasts my sweat covered face, causing me to drop on the deck and flop like a fish. The only upside is no one can tell I'm crying as it blends in with the waterfall of sweat.

I leave so dehydrated I'm peeing colors I didn't know existed. I had to hire one of the foosball team's assistants to follow me around and squirt Gatorade in my mouth to replenish all the fluids and electrolytes that now belong to the hall. 

Heald Hall is slated to be destructed and I will be there to watch, I don't care if its in 10 years and I have to miss the birth of my child, I'll be there front row, likely confusing the construction workers who are just trying to do their jobs, who don't need me heckling them, demanding they make the teardown painful as possible for the building. 

I was about to go all Milton from Office Space, but then I realized that lighting the building on fire would probably just strengthen it and make it even angrier.

I would rather do a project on my own and take my own grade down than take down a whole group grades down. For 5 years in all my group projects, I just sit there and pretend I know what I'm doing, repeating what my other members says so it sounds like I know whats going on when I dont. Half the time I BS all my work but pretend to know what I'm saying. Like my group shouldn't have to suffer from my works. Let the people who want to work on their own to work on their own. Im in 5 groups right now and I just smile and agree in each one because idk what I'm doing. I have no plan or use with my business degree. I just need a degree of any grade to get the job I want and I've already got the job I wanted which literally does not care about your grade or degree.

u9wrjv,Why am I the only one bothered about this?,"Mods plz look the other way., this is important to me.

On January 22nd, 2020, with over 100 million people watching, someone at Planters greenlit the idea to kill Mr. Peanut on live television. They thought they could just get away with it. Are they nuts? Where are the chex and balances? All the kids at the super bowl party were screaming, how was I supposed to console multiple screaming little kids cause idfk, yelling sure as hell didn't help. It just  gets me so mad!

Then they just replaced him as Baby Peanut like that makes any fucking sense, and used the hashtag #BabyNut, like yeah that's a great hashtag, good job. Why not wait until after Mr. Peanut's funeral? I couldn't even properly mourn without having babynut forced all over me. Do you know how hard it is when people ask ""what's wrong?"" and having to answer ""nothing"", rather than a 5 minute rant on planters absolute show of bafoonery? I still think he saw the error of his ways, that being selling his own kind to be eaten, or left being the only thing unsold in a vending machine, next to a bag or two of original sun chips and he couldn't do it anymore; so he cracked and Planters fucking killed him for it. 

Where does it end? Was Kraft like, ""Oh I know, lets have the Kool-Aid man run face first in to a brick wall and shatter into a million pieces?"" Why not sentence the Trix Rabbit to death by lethal injection? Or Mr. Clean gets deported. Lets have Tony the fucking Tiger get poached in India for God's sake. And their justification was totally lame to me; apparently they killed him off because of 'cease and desist'.

uf4acu,Does WSU have a bad reputation as a college?,"I notice that no matter professors, staffs, students,  alumni, or employers, no one thinks WSU is a good college. 

For professors and staffs, they just think WSU as a workplace with very low incomes. 

Many good professors tend to leave WSU and go to better colleges with higher incomes and better reputations. Even for those stay here, their children will never study in WSU. 

For current students, many of them complain the poor experience in the classes, the outdated dorms and facilities, as well as the high tuitions and service fees. 

For graduate students, they complain the low incomes as TAs or RAs. Many students are hard to find internships or jobs because of WSU's bad reputation in employers. 

Even Microsoft, WA's representation company doesn't come to WSU's career fair. SEL hires even more students from UI and Lewis &amp; Clark State College. 

Famous alumni don't want to donate money to WSU. Paul Allen donated more money to UW and Edmund Schweizer III donated more money to Purdue University.

ufalim,Tips for you that will help me out too,"This is mostly directed at the new students. Hi and welcome! The tips I have are two kinds of easy classes that I recommend taking: 

1. The first are the KIN\_ACTV classes. I feel like such a dunce that I only JUST figured out that I can take these! (I'm a senior.) So I haven't taken one yet, but I'm guessing they're the sort of class where all you really have to do to get the credit is show up and try. Getting regular exercise will boost your grades and being accountable can improve your adherence to exercise. (I legit used to teach fitness classes because I *need* that accountability or I just won't do it.) Also, my summer yoga class was just canceled and I don't want that to happen to the two KIN\_ACTV classes I've signed up for over the fall.
2. The second class is for anyone taking a foreign language. Use the 105, 205, and 305 conversation classes! These classes are so great and seriously underutilized. They give you the opportunity to safely make all the speaking errors that you're scared of making when talking to native speakers in your new language, and the class sizes are so small that it can meet you at your level. I *have* taken these classes and can tell you there is no homework; all that is required is that you show up and talk to one or two other people. Also, I want to teach one of the conversation courses in the fall and I can't do it if nobody signs up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/ufalim/tips_for_you_that_will_help_me_out_too/,socess,1,2022-04-30 08:59:59,0,/r/wsu/comments/ufalim/tips_for_you_that_will_help_me_out_too/
ufgypb,What is the community of WSU *really* like?,"I’m thinking about coming to the Pullman campus this fall. I’m a transfer student from a community college, so I’m already worried about starting a little late.

I’ve received a tour of the campus and everyone seemed nice, but I’m still really nervous. I know it’s a big school, but everyone there kinda seemed similar and intimidating. Like all of the girls were white, blonde, and so fashionable like I could never. I’m really nervous I won’t be able to fit in at all.

I’m a really shy girl and because I’m so different ethnically and not really a party person I’m worried I’ll stick out and be a loner. I really like all of the programs and resources at WSU, but I’m wondering if I should just go to WWU instead. That maybe I would fit in better there?

Does anyone have any insight into this? Is it easy to find your crowd, or is the diversity really as small as it seemed when I went?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/ufgypb/what_is_the_community_of_wsu_really_like/,shadowfallwolf,1,2022-04-30 14:27:27,0,/r/wsu/comments/ufgypb/what_is_the_community_of_wsu_really_like/

I was doing some research on Music Discovery, and I found that people's (Gen Z and Millenials) main complaint is that it takes too long to find new music you love on Spotify (sifting through new playlists).

This was the core insight that led me to develop a new way to recommend + shorten music/podcasts and I'd love to test it out now.

If you'd like I can email over a sample 1 minute playlist (just provide your favorite genre) using the shortening algorithm to test out.

**How it works**: It stitches together 10 songs (6 seconds each) with the best parts of a podcasts or song

uo7j77,Cpts 360 and KC Wang,"I took this class and I passed. But what the fuck was that. That class is a shit show and shouldn’t be taught that way at all. The fact that KC has been teaching it for decades and the school has done nothing to change the way it is taught pisses me off.

To be honest, 360 is the hardest class not because of the material but because of the horribly incoherent and confusing way it is taught. I could have learned the EXT2 file system using google and probably would not had been so stressed.

Because wsu doesn’t care about you at all and KC somehow still hasn’t retired. My advice to CS students is A) save your ucore classes to take during the semester you take 360 if possible. 360 is a 3 credit class but has like a 7 credit work load. B) study up on Linux and the EXT2 file system, understand how it works, because KC is a horrible teacher who uses a borderline arbitrary interview at the end for your final grade. Also make sure you know exactly how your code works for your final project. If you are like me. Someone who loves programming but not so much of a natural at it. Then you really need to prepare yourself because you will have to struggle your way through 360.

I am so glad I passed but it cost me sleep and an ungodly amount of stress and anxiety. To consider this class as “education” is pathetic. Wsu you should do better. We pay you an unethical amount of money for a good education. Not for shitty profs that force us to go learn the material online. I don’t need to pay 11k a year if I am going to use google to teach myself, I can do that for free.

I would like to thank the three TAs we had this semester in 360. Y’all knew your shit and were a god send.

uqlyba,Helene's Property Place drives me insane,"I bought a house and my friend applied to sublet my old apartment. She needed a cosigner, so she asks her mom, who is objectively rich. She retired from BP after working abroad for years for them, owns a house in Orange County and another house in Liberty Lake. Helene's says she can't cosign for her daughter because she doesn't have a job, as she is retired. 

But they accepted me as a cosigner -- I make 50k a year and am already responsible for a 1.7k mortgage, but yes, I am apparently a much safer option than a millionaire. (Not saying my situation isn't great, it is, but what the hell lol). 

I've never had a more annoying property manager as a Pullman/Moscow renter since 2015. Obviously DRA is the lowest of the low, but at least they don't need you to get a cosigner for a moldy basement. My best experience may have been Dabco actually. They didn't give a shit as long as I paid the rent and they actually came through and fixed problems when asked.

uvlvyu,Bypassing $50 fee to print extra copy/copies of diploma,"I just graduated and wanted to get another copy of my diploma so I could put one in the holder and one in a frame. However, there is a $50 charge to get an extra paper copy. 

You can however get a $5 ediploma which is a digitally signed copy for verification purposes, but it also contains a high resolution JPG of your diploma. The PDF is encrypted in a way that doesn't allow you to print it or export any pages as a JPG, but I found a site to get around this so I could print my own copy for way less than the outlandish $50 WSU wants.

Using the PDF you get from the $5 ediploma version, I used this website to convert the second page to a JPG which is great quality for taking to a print shop for a fraction of the cost! I recommend printing on parchment since that's what most diplomas and certificates are printed on, but you can do whatever you like. https://smallpdf.com/pdf-to-jpg

I am looking for 1 bed 1 bath &amp; cat friendly apartment. But it looks like the options are quite limited in Pullman at that time. I wonder if it is doable for me to live in Moscow ID? They have many more openings for 1 bed apartment at that time.

How is the public transportation between these two areas? Does the WSU campus bus route to Moscow? I am mostly concerned about snowy days. I am from the south so I am not familiar with driving on snow. Can I live in Moscow ID and commute to WSU everyday?

Thank you in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/uz9o9e/live_in_moscow_id_and_commute_to_wsu/,Important-Sleep-888,1,2022-05-27 18:37:06,0,/r/wsu/comments/uz9o9e/live_in_moscow_id_and_commute_to_wsu/

v28868,Molecular Programming - Reading Group,"Want to learn how to write computer programs that run outside of computers, in the real physical world?  


Want to use language, logic, and poetry to control the behavior of physical matter?  


The same switches that make up your laptops and cellphones can run on wet chemical reactions, instead of wired electronic circuits. These chemical computers can calculate square roots, recognize handwriting, and play a game of tic-tac-toe. But unlike electronics, the outputs of chemical computers are molecules that can bind to and rearrange physical matter. This allows chemical computers to algorithmically program physical matter to grow, heal, and directly sense and respond to stimuli... instead of merely lighting up pixels on a screen.  


Want to learn more? I will be starting an informal reading group at WSU in the fall to examine the field of molecular programming. DM me if you might want to participate. No experience necessary.

Just some background, I will be an incoming freshman for fall of 2022. My roommate and I were assigned Goldsworthy, and didn’t receive any of our top 10 choices. 

My roommate was approved for an accommodation to have a private bathroom from the accommodations office last Wednesday, and according to them it has been sent over to the housing office. However, after many failed attempts to get ahold of them, we still haven’t been notified of a dorm switch. 

Does anyone have any idea on the timeline of when the approved accommodation results in a dorm change? 

Also, I can see that via the website microwaves aren’t allowed in the dorm. If we are stuck there (and I’m hoping we will be moved) or other appliances okay? We wanted to bring a little tv, a coffee machine, etc.

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/v57i11/dorm_confusion/,SnooDoggos4250,1,2022-06-05 02:27:46,0,/r/wsu/comments/v57i11/dorm_confusion/
v58wi9,"If you can afford to not have a roommate and live alone if you’re moving into dorms, do it.","Before you read, be aware this is an Opinion and it is on the negative side.

I want to share with my fellow new cougs why I strongly do not recommend having a roommate as I know for many this sounds exciting your first year. I just want to offer a different perspective. And before you can assume my roommate last year was nice and we hardly ever had disagreements. To this day I wish her the best. Still, the simple thing of just having a roommate was what sucked. Single rooms are where it’s at and here’s why.

WSU makes little to no effort to match personalities/preferences so if you’re excited to have someone that has a lot in common with you maybe reconsider. I did not have a lot in common with mine even though I was very thorough in the questionnaire. Many of my friends said the same about their roommates. The biggest problem was that she preferred the window closed and I preferred it open, and she preferred the room very warm while I did not. You can imagine this was a struggle. 

Privacy when you’re in college is SO much more important than you could imagine and it’s very difficult to have that with a roommate. If you’re going through something they’re going to see that, if you feel exhausted you can take a nap but your roommate has a right to stay in the room and do their own thing. Possibly make more noise than you’re comfortable with. Phone calls, changing if you don’t like undressing in front of someone else, having time to relax on your own after a long day of classes can prove to be challenging. Do not underestimate the mental drain you can experience in college and prepare for it. Part of that is needing alone time and with a single you always have that option.

YOU WILL STILL MAKE FRIENDS WITHOUT A ROOMMATE. If that’s you’re only concern trust me you do not need a roommate to make a friend. WSU is full of clubs and different kinds of people. No matter how different you feel trust you will find your people. Do not worry and don’t sacrifice your privacy for a whole year or semester over the fear of not making friends. In fact, it may be easier to make friends since you can easily invite people over on your own terms. Again, it’s not a guarantee that you and your roommate will even be friends. You’ll have so many opportunities for gatherings with friends that you probably won’t feel alone in your room anyway.

You get to do whatever the hell you want in a single. If you want to go to bed early or stay up all night you don’t affect anyone. You can blast your music to your liking, use whatever scents you want in your room, you can decorate the whole room exactly how you want it, so much more. It stays the way you leave it. Get your own damn room if you can, it’s so worth it. I hope everyone’s college experience is awesome Go COUGS!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/v58wi9/if_you_can_afford_to_not_have_a_roommate_and_live/,Independent-Being-17,1,2022-06-05 04:15:12,0,/r/wsu/comments/v58wi9/if_you_can_afford_to_not_have_a_roommate_and_live/

va7dc8,dorm/apartment snacks,"What's your favorite snacks to have readily available in your dorm/apartment?

I was eating my fav snack microwave popcorn when I noticed what the brand had the audacity to christen themselves. ""Pop Secret"". It's called pop secret, you can't just fucking do that. Just because it rhymes doesn't mean you just use it. It has 0 connection with anything top secret. Was this what James Bond was munchin on after he finished munchin on your mom? (Sorry that was uncalled for and I apologize) but you see how riled up this gets me.

Wtf is top secret about it? It's just popping corn, its literally in the fucking name. And every Wal-Mart employee doesn't know what to tell me. What's gonna happen if I eat some without proper clearance? Are the pop-secret police gonna come pop out my nico nico kneecaps? I don't know what sort of fantasy land they're living in, but I refuse to stay silent. I've never stood for anything in my life but I'll stand for this, nothing about microwave popcorn has any business being classified.

vag71x,Just got assigned to Gannon/Goldsworthy! What should I expect in 2022?,"Hey all!  


Me and my friend just got our housing assigned and we got our 5th choice of housing with 2nd floor Gannon. I obviously would've preferred a Northside, or even Hillside hall, but I'm not *too* upset. (I am upset I didn't put Elmina White as a hillside preference, but oh well.) I'm pretty happy with being closer to the STEM side of campus, though. (Computer Engineering Major) However, I do have a few questions. 

  
First off, what should I expect? I heard it's a pretty social hall. How's the staff? And are the recreational longues any good?

  
Secondly, what are the differences between the Gannon and Goldsworthy side? I know they have some differences, but how extreme? Did I get the short end of the stick?

  
How does the pricing stack up to the other dorms? I know they are a bit similar, but am I going to be saving any substantial amount of money by rooming at ""the ghettos""?  


And if I *really* hate it, is it possible to transfer? Or am I stuck with it?  


Lastly, is *actually* that bad? I've heard the horror stories, but I tend to be pretty social so I doubt I'll be staying inside much anyways.

And if any of you chupacabras are reading this post I haven't forgotten my vow.

Anyway, please let me know how many times and where you've seen any chupacabras near campus and if you would be willing to help volunteer to man a heavily armed defense squad I'm forming? The police and WSU said 'no chance' they'd allow it but I think they'll change their minds.

I'm worried because my doctor told me I should try to avoid getting mauled by a chupacabra again if I can help it. Are there any proven defense methods?

vjf0zq,Is this a scam?,"I received an email last week from ""[sH7eO24xfrwh42h@netscape.india.net](mailto:sH7eO24xfrwh42h@netscape.india.net)"" and they were offering $1500 USD a week for simple administrative tasks that work around my schedule. It had a lot of typos but they must have just been excited to offer such a great opportunity. They did say they enjoy the American Yankees of baseball and funny man Tim Allen and I can relate to that.

They said they paid me a little early, but its cool, I repaid them with $1000 of google play cards and now I'm just waiting for the cash to start rolling in. However, I'm beginning to fear it may have been a scam. I now call on the most powerful thinkers in the world, a combination of reddit and discord to tell me if I was wrong.

I was a little suspicious at first, but I saw that despite the sending address, they signed it ""from proffesor Smith Mary, gorge washington state university state,"" so I think its legit as its illegal to impersonate a teacher, although I thought he retired 14 years ago and died 6 years ago, but I must be remembering wrong. 

I responded with my phone number as requested but no one called, however later a tech support company called me at 2:30 am, and if they're up that late they must be the good guys. I ended up paying them $200 for a comprehensive protection plan against scams so I think I ended up winning. I heard laughing and celebrating in the background, must have been having a birthday party. It was a little annoying to have to go get more google play cards, but their credit card reader was down.

I now realize that I may have been scammed. The email had a warning attached, ""external email"". Like duh its external, I didn't write it. At first I thought it was my fault, but no, it's the IT departments fault. Actually its WSU's fault. but wait, its actually the USAs fault if you think about it.

I promise I will not fall for this again, and if you want to help me recoup my losses, I have set up a gofundme. I'm not sure how it works so I'll just drop the username and password, just promise you'll only put money in, not take any out.

vktv49,Housing Recommendations for 2022 fall transfer.,"Hey, I will most likely be transferred to WSU this fall. I was hoping you guys could help me out by answering a few questions I have regarding housing.

I will be 20, and I'm transferring into Software Engineering. I value my privacy and would prefer to have my own room and restroom. I also enjoy cooking for myself, and I'm on a diet, so I would prefer to be able to cook and meal plan for myself. I plan on bringing my car to WSU as well. 

What would be the best residential hall? What are some differences between them? Recommend me some dorms?

Should I go with dorms or apartments? Cost isn't an issue. I have worked a remote job the majority of the pandemic and will be able to continue working remotely when I move up there. 

I have seen some postings on Zillow, Redfin, etc. I have also been thinking of getting an off-campus apartment or even a house just so I don't have to worry about space or having to worry about personal belongings. Worth it, or is this a little overkill? 

I know Reddit isn't the best place to come ask these sorts of things, but I would love to hear your personal experiences and what you would recommend and fellow students of WSU. I will also be calling the housing department and asking them a lot of questions, but I still would love to hear what y'all got.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/vktv49/housing_recommendations_for_2022_fall_transfer/,arctic_depth,1,2022-06-25 21:54:12,0,/r/wsu/comments/vktv49/housing_recommendations_for_2022_fall_transfer/

Please be careful and mindful of your surroundings. Bring the proper protection (knife, pepper spray, concealed carry if you are able to get one) because the cops do and will not care.

College GPA: 3.1 
Last semester: 2.4 

My last semester I actually withdrew, and the 2.4 was from fall. This GPA is below the requirement but not my overall gpa. 

I just want to get a refund if they only look at last semester. I won’t rush with those grades. 

But I do have leadership experience, and community involvement. I work for a non-profit in hunger relief and partner with various food pantries to improve their nutritional environment, and hold nutrition education for the public.
I also hold a seat on the public policy  committee in my state’s Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. (My major is Nutrition and Exercise Physiology) 

I have done a lot in the past 2 years and going to school, I burned out. Which is why I’m just going to go to school full time, no work! 

But is this good enough for sororities? I started strong with a 3.75 and then obviously it dwindled.

According the article and the CEOs own words “we really believe in the dignity of every human life, and that means at whatever age or race or ability level or socio-economic level” unless of course you’re referring to women’s autonomy. 


According to someone that went to the clinic they “would not let her leave until she named her child after a positive pregnancy test”, and as per other peoples allegations they “often mislead patients about how far along they are in a pregnancy” after ultrasounds. 


My first thought was this has to be a business related to the Christ Church cult in Moscow trying to sink in their grifter claws in Pullman, but nothing I’ve found supports that yet besides the CEO being Catholic and active in the Moscow church scene.

vnz8ov,Questions about Master's Program,"I've got a long post, so sorry in advance. 

I've been trying to get answers about this from my advisor but they keep skirting around the issue so I'll see if anyone here can help. I'll be completing my Bachelor's next year and am planning to get my Master's afterwards. WSU doesn't really have much in exactly what I'm looking for, so I'm trying to figure some stuff out. First, I'm trying to get into psychopharmaceuticals with the hopes of finding less side effect heavy medications for people with mental disorders. However, I haven't found much help from the WSU pharmacy school for what I'm looking for, among other issues. 

Currently I'll be graduating with my Bachelor's in General Biology and a minor in Research Writing and I'm unsure of what Master's program would be most beneficial for my specific field. Most of the Psychopharmacology research being done at WSU is involving canaboids so I'm not sure what a decent alternative program would be to try and further myself in my field and be more competitive. 

Also, what is the process of going into a Master's program? I know each is different, but is there a long wait time between getting my Bachelor's and getting confirmation of acceptance? When are applications for Master's programs typically due?

Another concern I have is regarding the program itself. I understand that most of the Master's programs I've been recommended thus far pay for you being a TA and I want to understand more about that and what the programs are like. I'm currently living with family but am hoping to live on my own after obtaining my Bachelor's, so is there some kind of cheap student housing, or would it be cheaper to just stay with the off-campus apartments? I currently pay around $650 for my current apartment.

Also, what is a typical Master's program like? Everytime I've asked my advisor they say ""It's different for everyone"", which I get, but I'm just looking for some insight into what exactly I would be doing as a student. Is it mostly classes and TAing or is there something more to it? How are the Master's program classes as compared to, say, 300-400 level Bachelor's classes? 

The last thing I'm trying to figure out is, who should I talk to about after college stuff? My advisor hasn't really helped to understand what things will be like after college. Like who I should speak to or what exactly happens afterwards. Most of what I have found out is stuff that I have specifically found myself. I'm trying to find corporations/companies that might be beneficial to work towards my goals. But I haven't really been given any resources to seeking those out. I know I've got some time before I complete my Master's, but I really need to know in advance. 

Any help at all would be greatly appreciated. With this being my last year before I get my Bachelor's, I feel like the clock is ticking to start getting these questions answered. And to get real answers, not vague ones.

w35t25,"I got a furnished WSU apartment, but need to get rid of the furniture","So our group had to settle for a furnished chinook village apartment due to the fact the other two had been living in dorms prior and didn't have any personal furniture. I'm a transfer student from out of town with bedroom furniture sitting in a storage shed that I'd like to use because I've seen that dinky ass furniture they provide and I'm not having it. I also spent a decent amount on my bedroom furniture so I need to use it and I'm not going to pay forever for it to be in a storage unit. 

I talked to housing services which provided no help and was actually a little infuriating with how they were over the phone which boiled down to me renting a storage unit in town to store the furniture. Obviously that isn't an option since that'd be like 100 per month. My first idea was that maybe the university had a surplus storage that they keep apartment furniture in just in case of replacement, but the lady thought I was stupid for even assuming that. My next option was to take apart the furniture and my brother would just drive it back to my hometown to keep in his garage until the end of the school year in which I'd bring it back and reassemble it. My final option was just throwing it away and eating the cost as it'd be cheaper then renting a storage to hold onto it.

I can't be the only one to have run into this issue, so I was wondering if anyone had advice or has been through this themselves. I honestly thought this would be a rather simple fix but alas I need your help :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/w35t25/i_got_a_furnished_wsu_apartment_but_need_to_get/,LVLZero,1,2022-07-19 18:41:57,0,/r/wsu/comments/w35t25/i_got_a_furnished_wsu_apartment_but_need_to_get/

w3d5bi,Is it wrong to be luring orientation kids into Todd Hall?,"That place is so confusing, I feel like I'm in looney tunes or a fucking scooby doo hallway. I go in classrooms and come out of bathrooms only to fall upside down up a flight of stairs. It makes no fucking sense. who designed this? why are there so many corners and turns? I did the math and it just doesn't add up. There are degrees missing, and not just mine.

So I started luring kids into this hell hole to give them a warning. I'd stalk orientation groups until someone falls back a little and I'd pounce like a bobcat, or some other large mountain cat.

I'd promise free ice cream and a balloon if they follow me for a tour of todd hall. I'd lead them into a random classroom on the third floor. When they show up it's just a single plastic spoon full of freezer burned vanilla ice cream, that's it. But not even like a full spoonful, just like half way. And the balloon is not inflated, welcome to the real world. These poor kids are just disappointingly licking this plastic spoon unaware of what's to come.

Their full trust is gained however, when their ears are serenaded by the welcoming song ""lets get it started in here"" by the black eyed peas. The siren-like voices of [will.i.am](https://will.i.am) and fergy (and who ever the fuck the other peas are) lure them into a false sense of security. I proceed to pocket sand them and vanish, but not before popping their balloon.

The black eyed peas fades into a building wide loop of ""wake me up before you go go"" interrupted intermittently by random 10 second snippets of insane clown posse. They won't know what hit them, but I will. It was me, I hit them.

They are a little annoyed but think it's just a simple matter of retracing their steps. Nope. Little do they know of the maze that is todd hall. Start them on the 3rd floor and its over. They wander for hours, desperately trying to find a way out to no avail. The stairwells are constantly shifting like the ones in harry potter, and eventually the room numbers turn into wingdings. They walk one path and pass the same half-full starbucks cup for rebecca for the 4th time.

Their cries for help go unanswered, the only the beast in this maze is themselves. And Mugma. Don't forget Mugma, the 24ft long worm that senses movement and hates the insane clown posse. 

The fire extinguishers shoot water and the water fountains shoot fire extinguisher. The time is only tracked by the chimes of the clock tower, or with their phones idk.

Eventually I take pity and lead them out a side door. By the time they rejoin their group, they've aged like 6 years, but now appreciate the insane clown posse slightly more.

Is this frowned upon?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/w3d5bi/is_it_wrong_to_be_luring_orientation_kids_into/,fkin_end_me,1,2022-07-20 00:31:36,0,/r/wsu/comments/w3d5bi/is_it_wrong_to_be_luring_orientation_kids_into/

My name is Kacey and I am the creator and current owner of the Discord Server DisCougs\*. We are a community of prospective, current, and past WSU students that formed near the start of the pandemic. *Happy 2nd Birthday to us!!!* 

A new academic year will soon to be upon us and I wanted to make sure all incoming students had a community to go to and a resource to reference as they make the transition to Pullman and WSU! In short, we are a community of 2500 prospective, current, and past WSU students with a great amount of Cougar pride. We have a multitude of channels for fellow Cougs to chat, find friends, ask questions about homework, classes, housing, or majors, and to advertise your own social media, events, or clubs! We even have our own Minecraft server and plan to host more virtual or in-person events in the future as past events have been very successful. There are also leadership/management positions available if you would like to help out the server and grow your own skills at the same time! 

Our goal is to provide a platform for any WSU student so they can find their niche and community, whether that be on DisCougs itself, or somewhere else on campus. Feel free to drop in and say hi anytime! GO COUGS!!

w43axa,Need some advice as a transfer student with a poor GPA," 

Alright, I’m in a bit of a pickle here. Could really use some advice if anyone has any! Sorry this is a bit of a longer post, I feel like my issue is very specific. I’m planning on sending an email to campus to get some answers too, as well as talk to an advisor at my school, but I figured I’d ask the kind community here as well!

So, I’ve been attending community college as a Washington resident. Well, I was. Due to my declining mental health, I had to drop school altogether for a few years. Biggest problem is, I forgot to withdraw from one of my classes, and now it’s a 0.0 on my record, bringing my GPA from about 3.5 down to a crispy 2.7. Completely my fault, totally regret it and I’m kicking myself for it.

Recently, my mental health has been getting much, much better thankfully! I actually want to do something with my life now, which is why I want to transfer to WSU. Heard it has a good computer science program, and the school looks easy enough to get into. To top it off, my dad graduated from WSU in the early 90s I believe? He seems to like the school well enough, and says the STEM majors are pretty good there, which seems to line up with other peoples’ experiences.

Anyways, my fiance and I are planning on renting an off campus apartment in Pullman, year round so we don’t have to move our stuff for the duration of my education. I know it’s good to get housing as early as possible. My concern is, I don’t know if I’m going to be able to get in until all the affordable apartments are taken up. I’ve heard that you generally want a GPA of 3.0 or higher to have a good chance of getting in, right? I know they have a high acceptance rate, I’m just so terrified of renting an apartment only to find out I didn’t get in. We currently live with my dad, so I want to stay as long as possible to save money, but I’m also worried that if I DO get in, but I hesitate on getting a place until I know for sure, that there won’t be any affordable homes available and that I’ll have to wait until 2024 to attend.

I’m trying to bring up my GPA first, but I’m seriously worried that I’ll need two quarters to get it to 3.0 or above. I wouldn’t know my actual GPA or be able to get an official transcript until late March, if I do need to take a second quarter. It’s such a pain for me that WSU starts so early in the year compared to just about every other school in Washington.

I’m not sure what exactly I’m asking... Is it still likely I’ll get in with a GPA of under 3.0, especially if I already have a few credits done as a transfer student? Is it possible to reserve a non-campus apartment until I’m sure I can get in? Will there still be decent places available after, say, May or June? Do you think I’d be able to get my GPA to 3.0 within one quarter, and how many classes do you think I’d need to take and get good grades in to do so? I was planning on 2 classes for Fall at the community college to ease myself back into it, do you think this would be enough, if I got excellent grades in both classes?

Additional info: I went to a high school that doesn’t give a GPA, it was very non-traditional. I also have no idea how I would get my SAT scores, or if they would even count at this point since I’m 23 now and it’s been so long.

I’m so sorry, I know this is so long. I hope it all makes sense. I’m pretty overwhelmed trying to figure it all out.

•Does anyone have advice on how to make  WSU connections/friends even though I will be completing my degree fully remote from Seattle? 

•Am I going to regret taking 18 credit hours per semester this year? I figured taking on more classes at the freshman level would be easier than trying to accelerate my degree completion once I am taking 300-400 level courses. I won’t be working and will only be focused on school for now.

•What is the online class platform like? Is it just a lot of making/responding to posts? Or is there typically a lot of actual assignments to make up for the fact that I am not attending classes in person? Is it safe to assume the lectures are recorded?

•Is completing the Global Campus Cougar Leadership Certificate worth the time investment?

•Are there any good online clubs to join?

•Does anyone have a favorite prof to take classes from in the psychology department? And on the flip side, is there an instructor you would recommend I avoid taking a class from?

1. How is the apartment atmosphere? I am pretty quiet but don’t mind some noise. 

2. If anyone has pictures of the one-bed apt. I would like to see them!! It would be beneficial to me.

3. I plan to commute in my car. Will I have a dedicated spot, or will I have to park anywhere? I did pay the parking fee.

4. What are some essential items to have in an apartment? I know all the basics, but I am missing some hidden things.

5. Does the bus run in the winter? I have heard many mixed things. Can it go around with all the snow?

6. How is the tv? What brand is it?

we21vy,You think I could sneak into the grizzly bear sanctuary and go on a zany adventure?,"Just found out WSU has a grizzly bear sanctuary, so naturally my first thought is to sneak in and show them a good time out on the town. Assuming I could dress up as a bear (easy), sneak into the sanctuary (also easy), gain their trust and successfully communicate (intermediate), and ignoring friction, do you think it's possible to befriend a bear family and gain their acceptance?

Some dude at a bar in jean shorts called me a bear and winked at me, which could only be a sign I should go ahead with the plan. You might ask yourself, isn't this guy afraid of jumping into a den of wild bears? He ain't no Joe Exotic. Well I can assure you, I'm not afraid of anything. except spiders. and spending the rest of my life alone. and grizzly bea--ah shit... 

Anyway I doubt I'd end up as supper (I've started calling dinner supper by the way) because my disguise is pretty good, although I don't have anything resembling bear claws so I'm hoping my mickey mouse gloves will be good enough. I was also considering covering my skin with brown paint but my lawyer was strongly against it so ill just go with my long sleeve Chewbacca shirt (great guy btw).

If I get caught by the handlers I'll just pretend to be a bear visiting from montana. I could pretend my already existing ankle bracelet is one of their tracking devices. I'm 99% sure this will work, I've practically been hibernating all summer so I'm ready.

I'll convince a family of bears to adopt me and we'll hang out and go to restaurants and stuff, even trying out the Man vs Wild host's bear themed grill. And they wont like it so they'll insist I write an article titled 'grizzly bears grill Bear Grylls' bear grill'.

Cue the montage of us. probably to the song 'wouldn't it be nice' by the Beach Boys. We'll be on one of those long bicycles with 4 seats, getting cotton candy, flipping some cars in the Ross parking lot, putting our heads in those big photo cut out boards, and to finish, we'll stick up a Black Bear Diner.

And then the Diner will issue an insurance claim and the investigator will review the security footage and will be like ""there's no way those are real bears holding glocks sideways, it must be fake."" and the Diner will be like, ""it's clearly real bears in the video"", and the investigator will go ""yeah but they look just like your waiters,"" and the Diner'll go, ""wait, did you think our waiters were supposed to look like actual black bears?"" and they'll just stare at each other. 

But anyway, the whole time I'll attempt to teach them one human phrase by mass repetition. Imagine being the dude who feeds them and the bears just like, 'Hows it goin?' in a minnesotan accent. Then I'll write a book about our adventure called 'Brother Bear', and proceed to immediately get sued by Disney, so I'll change the name to ""Brother Bear 2"" and get sued even harder, and since I have no chance in court ill cut a deal in which I get beat senseless by a representative in a Minnie Mouse costume. No one fucks with the mouse.

How far do you think I'll get? I'm thinking no less than the tandem bicycle but idk what to do if they don't know how to ride a bike, it'll be tough for only me to pedal with like 1700lbs total up these bullshit hills.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/we21vy/you_think_i_could_sneak_into_the_grizzly_bear/,fkin_end_me,1,2022-08-02 00:21:17,0,/r/wsu/comments/we21vy/you_think_i_could_sneak_into_the_grizzly_bear/

However, the cost of WSU Global is only around $7000. 

They haven’t changed it. Granted, if they didn’t change it I wouldn’t be mad because that would be a very nice refund check. But I’m also worried they are going to realize they are way over paying me and I’ll suddenly end up owing them, or that they will drastically lower it. I do need a good sized refund check to help with school related costs and rent, especially because I still work at the college part time and it’s 1.5 hours away.

wplaeo,Why is Aspen moving some ppl to the hills and some to the ruckus?,"So I made the grave mistake of signing with aspen… when I met with them last week about this whole ordeal I was told that they couldn’t move people into the units that are ready because it violates the fair housing act to not move everyone in at the same time. And that they also couldn’t move people into the hills because there wasn’t enough space for everyone and it would violate the fair housing act to move some people into the ruckus and some into the hills. Well, today when I was moving into the ruckus I found out that some people got placed into the hills! This has all been such bs and they keep lying to us and refuse to put any of our conversations in writing when I ask them to. 

The apartment we got at the ruckus is disgusting. I knew it wouldn’t be nice but there is visible dirt on nearly all of the surfaces and mold!!! I don’t care as much about my own health, but no way in hell I’m moving my little dog into a moldy apartment!

I am a CS grad student at WSU Pullman. I am conducting a research study about music listening and stress and looking for participants. 

The study has two parts. In the first stage, the participant first completes an online survey that asks them about their music listening habits and other information. The second stage is an in-person one-hour session for sensor data collection. We use an Empatica E4 wristband to collect heart rate, skin conductance, and acceleration data. Ultimately, we will use the sensor data and online survey information to study the relationship between music listening and stress. 

As a gesture of thanks, we give each participant a FitBit device that can track physical activity and sleep. 

If you want to participate, please complete the online survey here  [https://wsu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_410n07rlEBPNvsF](https://wsu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_410n07rlEBPNvsF)

x9eoco,Seeking cofounders to help reignite stalled AI-based summarization tool startup.,"Hey all,

 A few years ago, I, along with a couple of other people created a startup around a product idea that was meant to be an advanced and efficient summarization AI model, which would create abstractive, nonplagiarized summaries while retaining the essence of the text being summarized. Surprisingly, we were able to at least implement aspects of our product idea, even creating a somewhat finished test app around the product and really developing the other aspects of the project, with a host of pitch decks, investor contact lists, and executive summaries. Things were turning so well for us in fact, that we even were able to get a meeting with the CEO of Snapchat. However, nothing came to fruition from that as we had hoped, and due to a variety of compounding factors such as school, work, and especially team communication, one by one, the other members of the project left(as well as relinquishing their legal involvement with this project), leaving just me with the pieces. However, I still have much of our investor/business material and work on my google drive, and can likely gain access to the majority of tech aspects of our project(the unfinished app, base code/AI algorithm, etc).  So, even though over 90 percent of startups fail, I believe that this project deserves to be reignited, that's why I am looking for skilled cofounders(particularly in Biz Dev, tech, and marketing) that would be of course EQUAL equity, and who are motivated in making sure this project beats that statistic!

As for a bit of background on me, I am a college student, with a passion for exploring new ideas and have thrown myself into a wide area of diverse projects, which have allowed me to gain a variety of unique and impactful experiences that I believe will translate well into the startup field. If you're interested in becoming a co-founder of this project, just hit me up with a DM anytime!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/x9eoco/seeking_cofounders_to_help_reignite_stalled/,thingbubba,1,2022-09-08 19:03:38,0,/r/wsu/comments/x9eoco/seeking_cofounders_to_help_reignite_stalled/

xdpzo4,Student Leadership Opportunity: Helping Homeless Communities,"Hi everyone! **Hearts for the Homeless International** is a student-led nonprofit organization that provides free blood-pressure screening opportunities and heart health education to homeless populations around the United States and globally. We are a team of undergraduate students, medical students, PhD students, medical doctors, and other professionals who are invested in improving the well-being of homeless communities around the world- including yours. H4H was originally founded by students at the University of Central Florida and has since grown into an international organization with over 15 chapters across the United States, Brazil, and India. With your passion, we aim to work with you to help you positively impact your homeless community. Together, we can better fulfill our goal of improving the condition of humanity! 

We are **interested in working with student leaders** who want to innovate, to serve, and to enact change. For student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time, leadership, and compassion. We will take care of the rest. The lives you will change, the friends you will make, and the experiences you will gain will be invaluable.

The work of our students has helped so many, and for this reason, it has been recognized by the US Congress, the Brazilian government, President Clinton, educational and medical institutions, and other non-profit institutions as well. Some of our other significant achievements include leading an effort to rescue the homeless in multiple cities from hurricanes, partnering with Shark Tank’s Bombas Socks, as well as being published by [Forbes Magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2017/11/06/how-young-leaders-are-strengthening-community-responses-to-disasters/#77391a361850). 

We want to be able to help serve the struggling homeless community in Seattle. Just last year, it was discovered that the situation was worse than expected. According to a recent [study](https://www.security.org/resources/homeless-statistics/) by safety resource Security.org, Washington has the sixth highest rate of homelessness per 100,000 people.

As the Hearts for the Homeless Pullman President, you will positively impact your community with a great international team supporting your drive to help others and implementing any great ideas you suggest.

xyn7l8,"Questions about psychology major versus a business major, planning on applying to law school after my undergraduate studies.","I am a transfer student who is a junior technically and want to apply to law school after I finish my undergraduate studies. I was going to study psychology recently and then I switched to business with a concentration in management.

My thought of studying business is in case I don’t apply to law school like I initially thought I would have this degree to utilize. I should mention I’m an online student so the business courses are seven weeks instead of a full semester.

I came from a quarter system prior but am thinking a psychology major might be easier to keep my grades up. I have all A’s right now but it is hard to remember everything I need within seven weeks. 

Since my main goal is to attend law school any thoughts? Also, I don’t want to do a political science or English degree. 

I have valid reasons in regards for preparation for the LSAT and looking more competitive due to not studying the typical subjects which is becoming more common among law school applicants. 

Any input would be much appreciated. Perhaps not the usual post but looking for feedback from psych majors on how hard the coursework is, and I suppose business majors on how hard the more in depth you get.

y0n4sp,Advice for Selling Items in Pullman,"So, recently I was diagnosed with several disabilities that not only made it difficult to keep up with a full course schedule, but also made it virtually impossible to work the way I wanted to this semester. Now I’m trying to recoup some costs, get some living expenses paid, and liquidate assets in the hope of potentially getting SSI payments by selling items (an old MacBook, iPad, unused headphones, etc). Some items are electronics but I also have collectors plushes (squishmallows), small furniture, artisan jewelry, books, and some video games I’m parting with. 

Where are the best places to sell these types of things in Pullman or on campus for a good value? Is there a WSU/Pullman resale Reddit or Facebook group I could go to? Is my best bet to try to sell through Palouse Treasures?

y0n7jd,Pullman Thanksgiving Meals Giveaway / Food Drive - Round 2,"Hey everybody, Rob here, organizer of the Pullman Thanksgiving Meal Giveaway and Food Drive [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/qiq71s/cougs_i_am_setting_up_a_food_giveaway_for_the_day/). It turned into a fantastic success.  
  
- We gave away roughly 21 full Thanksgiving meals to people in need in Pullman  
- All kits that were not given out that day were donated directly, and the food drive portion of the event brought in hundreds of pounds of food to donate directly to the [WSU Cougar Food Pantry](https://studentcare.wsu.edu/student-assistance/pullman/food-assistance/the-cougar-food-pantry/)  
- We made the front page of the [Moscow Pullman Daily News](https://dnews.com/local/giving-a-taste-of-thanksgiving/article_ccbe1ab6-fadb-5a57-9223-e01171453bf7.html) (slow news day, but still neat)  
- Learned some great lessons along the way  
- Had the opportunity to interact with many members of the community and meet people from all walks of life  
  
That all being said, we're going to do it again this year. The planning stage is just kicking off, so if you'd like to get involved please let me know and I'll see if there is a way you can help out. Donations are greatly appreciated as we did this entirely out of pocket last year, which we'll gladly do again but any donations go directly back to the community. We will also provide food (likely pizza) to anyone who brings by food donations during the food drive.  
  
Date: 11/23/22 (Wednesday before Thanksgiving)  
Time: 1:00pm - 5:00pm  
Location: Pullman City Hall, Senior Center (first floor of the Recreation Center Building)  
  
The theme this year will be very similar - moderately shelf stable meals that lean towards traditional Thanksgiving style food (and easy to prepare without an industrial kitchen), given out with no questions asked. There are no meetings to attend, nothing to sign up for. No religious or political bend, no mailing lists. If you need food and want to feel like you're having a normal-ish Thanksgiving, grab a meal.  
  
Student who's stuck in town over break? You're more than welcome as well.  
  
After last year we did learn a few lessons, and we've made some improvements already:  
  
1. We're moving indoors this year. We've worked with the City of Pullman to host the event at the Senior Center. As much fun as spending a day in the park was last year it got so cold that eventually my propane bottles froze and the heater gave out. This year we've planned ahead better and secured an indoor space.  
2. We'll be running a meal signup this year. I will have additional meals prepared for walk-ups as well, but this will help us better plan for who needs what.  
3. I plan on making myself available to deliver limited meals directly to homes within Pullman either the evening of the drive or Thanksgiving morning. I realize that not everyone can make it to a location at a set time, so I'm going to work to do what I can to help those people out personally.  
  
If you're interested in signing up for a meal, please [use this link](https://forms.gle/VYzHD3jWNVTw18wB6).  
  
If you are an individual or business looking for ways to donate, get involved, help, etc., please DM me here, reply to this post, or email foodforpullman@gmail.com  
  
Thank you to everyone who helped last year, showed up to get some food, or sent along well wishes. Hopefully this year goes just as well. One way you can help without direct involvement is sharing this post to anyone who may need to see it.

y3tevc,When do cougar calves stop?,"I'm starting to get worried. They're the hardest muscle to gain mass, so initially I welcomed the gains, but they won't stop getting bigger and bigger. I look like I just got done with the 9th stage of the Tour de France. I'm straight up Lance Armstrong up in here (not the balls part). I look like a damn isosceles triangle. 

At this point if I accidentally flex both calves I pass right out. The only pants I can wear now are bellbottom jeans. If I stand up too fast I'll go straight into the ceiling. What am I supposed to do? I walk uphill to school, and then uphill back home. My calves have taken over my pillow and make me sleep facing the other way. They've disenrolled me from my CS major (no complaints there) and enrolled me exclusively in PE classes. And physics, because you can't run away from that shit.

They're taking over. I awoke suddenly last night to find myself sprinting up a hill. They've formed a conscious and have started whispering to me, ""Take the stairs"", ""You don't need a chair, just squat"", ""Why drive through the pass this winter? You can make it on bike.""

I was thinking about getting them surgically reduced, but I'm scared of a Spiderman 2 Doctor Octopus scenario where my calves take over and I end up karate kid crane kicking an entire hospital wing. The cows on campus wont stop cowcalling me after spotting my hunks of beef, either that or they're confusing my calves for their own young.

y46ejq,More roommate issues!,"Mostly just to vent but advice might be nice. So I posted a while ago on my alt account about my last roommate, who I had to move away from because of her mental health issues. I deleted that post, but basically she was hallucinating and it was getting to the point where it was unsafe to be around. Well, despite saying I didn't want to live in the dorm I was originally in (because I didn't want to be around my old roommate), my RED literally just moved me down a floor.

Cue new roommate bullshit! First of all, when I moved in, she said a total of six words to me. I tried to talk to her multiple times, but she just ignored me or responded with one word. When I explained why I moved down there, and that I didn't choose it, she literally said nothing. I know I'm pretty socially awkward, but I thought this chick had something genuinely wrong with her. She didn't (and still doesn't) say shit to me, which was honestly fine because I'm usually busy with other stuff and I'm out of the dorm most days from like 8 am until late at night.

Until I got a concussion from that other stuff! A really severe one. I can't go to classes and I'm not supposed to be looking at screens. That also meant sitting in silence and dark for as long as possible. No problem, right? I've got a dorm.

Fucking psyche! I told this girl I had a concussion and said I needed to turn off the main light because it made my symptoms worse. Her response? A scowl and ""I don't care."" I took two days off from class, I was supposed to take a week, and it got to the point where I couldn't stand being in my dorm anymore. She came back and SHOUTED to her family and friends on the phone, turned on like fifty lights including very bright LED lights that I can't control, and just generally made my concussion worse. Don't even get me started on trying to sleep. Between her and the other dumbass freshman on my floor, there is no shot I can get more than four hours of sleep a night.  I literally gave up (and I know everyone is gonna be like 'JUST TALK TO HER') and put in a request for a single dorm that I know isn't gonna get fulfilled.

The icing on the proverbial cake, she's gone for a day. I came back to the dorm and she put sticky notes on all her shit that say ""DON'T TOUCH"" in red marker in all caps. I have never touched any of her stuff. I don't even go near her side of the room. The only time I've done that is when I turned off her LED lights because she left them on at like midnight and left to go party, and I had to wake up at like 6 am the next morning. This is the most insane bullshit I've had to deal with, it makes me miss my old roommate and her hallucinations. And I don't have any faith that Housing or my RED will help me fix it. I have plans to move into an apartment with friends next year and it's pretty much the only thing that's keeping me going.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/y46ejq/more_roommate_issues/,Grace-I-Guess,1,2022-10-14 17:54:25,0,/r/wsu/comments/y46ejq/more_roommate_issues/

y4q25x,What is the WSU Online Experience like in 2022?,"TLDR; What are the positives / negatives of the actual online portal? Does it feel like a collection of PDF's that you read through? Or is there actual teaching and curated learning experience?

---

Hey there!

For my undergrad, I completed my degree completely online through Southern New Hampshire University. The school isn't know for difficulty and rigger, but in my opinion, the actual online experience is great. The online portal rarely (if ever) has bugs. Each week's section is intractable. Discussion posts allow threads. Its easy to view your grades and see teacher feedback. It's easy to separate notifications related to a comment on a discussion post vs an announcement from the teacher vs a update to a graded assignment. 

Currently I'm in an intensive certificate program at the University of Southern California San Diego and the online experience is horrible. It's a much more ""impressive"" school with more ""rigor,"" but simply handing in assignments is a 5 step process that's easy to mess up and loos credit with. Each week's section is a recording of a single power-point presentation, where the teacher reads the textbook aloud. There is no intractable course work. There are no class discussions. Checking / viewing teacher feedback is a hassle.

That being said, where does WSU fall in terms of the online experience? Does it feel like a collection of PDF's that you read through? Or is there actual teaching and curated learning experience?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/y4q25x/what_is_the_wsu_online_experience_like_in_2022/,the_nameless_nomad,1,2022-10-15 10:57:46,0,/r/wsu/comments/y4q25x/what_is_the_wsu_online_experience_like_in_2022/

y5glp4,It's tearing me acart,"I've not once gotten a normal cart at walmart. I swear there's someone whose only job is to radio in when I pull into the parking lot, and then another employee will drop what they're doing and sprint to put all the broken carts in the front of each cart stack so I always grab one. And its not like all their carts are broken, it always seems like everybody else's cart is fine and mine is either shrieking the song of its people or at least one wheel is doing whatever the fuck it wants. 

A family of 5 is walking towards me in an aisle? There's a 50/50 shot this cart will kamikaze into them. I'll take one and walk like 10 steps and be like, ok cool this one works, and then the first turn I make the front left wheel will start to have a seizure and from then on do the exact opposite of what I want it to do. Then the whole time it'll be like an 1800's train with a CHUGACHUGACHUGA sound and it draws attention to me filling my cart with mainly donuts (I'm a fiend for donuts).

Its a full on forearm workout, I'm not even steering the cart anymore, I'm just holding on for dear life as the cart chooses what aisle we're going down. I had no plans to be in the cake aisle but I might as well get this Betty Crocker frosting. By the end I somehow end up in the cart and it tries to buy me. But then the cashier's like ""Yeah this guy is useless you can just take him for free"". Yeah sure I could just go back and get a different cart, but if you don't like your kid you're not just gonna go back to the hospital and get a better one, I've made a commitment.

I want to get a job there just so I can take all the special carts out to the back and get my revenge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wsu/comments/y5glp4/its_tearing_me_acart/,fkin_end_me,1,2022-10-16 09:16:59,0,/r/wsu/comments/y5glp4/its_tearing_me_acart/

y74oud,Urec center now requiring paid parking even for students.,"Alright so, last year the urec parking lot had a sign stating that students get 130 minutes of free parking at the rec. This year the sign was removed and no postings are up. Online it states we get only 105 minutes of free parking… with a trick. You have to register your car every time on that old machine inside tucked on the side of the entrance. 

I parked there for 30 minutes and was fined $60. 

Wsu transportation is being crooked this year. 

First it started with them combining the two most popular bus routes that lead to campus. This made the buses so full they were skipping stops because they had no room, this also caused the routes to be screwed and the timing as well. 
I’ve parked in the garage as well and  took the elevator up to the parking machine, paid for my time, only to find a ticket on my car… I parked at 2pm and at 2:07 they had already ran my plates and ticked my car yet again for $60. People don’t even get fined this much for parking tickets in the city…

The AMP parking app only works on some days as it crashes as soon as the app is opened. Now WSU transportation is relying on the app only in the garages.
