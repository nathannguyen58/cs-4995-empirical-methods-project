bp0tc0,"Apartments near OSU, which ones should I take a closer look at?","I'm an adult student, who lives with my boyfriend. I want to avoid room mate situations and prefer to live alone, preferably with my boyfriend (he's not a student, will likely be in/out) but he will be there more often than not which doesn't work with most guest policies I've seen.

I'd prefer some amenities a pool would be nice but not necessary, parking, if it's to far away I'd prefer a bus stop nearby. (I live in the boonies and city driving isn't my favorite)

Prefer to pay less than 1,000/month for both my boyfriend and I to be on the lease, 1 bed 1 bath is fine. I am a smoker, so the places that disallow smoking on the property is no bueno, however I don't care to smoke indoors at all. I want to avoid heavy party scenes, and what not.

bs0vsk,Prescription glasses,"Hello to everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm moving from Italy to Stillwater to study at OSU, and since I don't have the finest eye set, I was wondering how much does it cost to get prescription glasses in the US or specifically in the city. Here in Italy my glasses cost around 500 € (100 for the frame and then 200 a piece for the lenses). I have both eyes suffering of  hypermetropia (or farsightedness, not sure about terminology in english), and in Italy we rate it on a scale from one to 10 where 10 is perfect vision and 0 is whatever 0 is. I'm 6 in one eye and 4 on the other.

I hope I explained myself!

cmh961,STAY AWAY FROM CAMPBELL MANAGEMENT,"For all of you students or parents that are looking to rent property, please let me give you some advice.  Stay far away from any properties managed by Campbell Management Properties.  They are incompetent.  My daughter lived at Trails End for four years, we payed her rent on time for this entire time.  We left the property SO MUCH CLEANER than we found it and it has now been almost three months and we have yet to receive her deposit check.  Most of the time, no one answers their phone.  You can't leave any messages because all of their voice mail boxes are full.  I spent almost two full days trying to reach a human being.  Quite by accident, the owner of the company answered the phone when I called the main line and he was actually talking to someone else when he picked up the phone.  I actually laughed as it was quite obvious he wasn't expecting someone from the public on the other end of the phone.  I proceeded to explain what I needed and he told me that he was too busy to talk, that he had seven people waiting on him and I needed to call back when I had the exact address.  I explained that I left the exact address last week when I left two messsages on two different people's voicemail boxes but that today, I just needed him to look things up by my daughters name (which the receptionists have always done in the past).  He was rude and so incredibly arrogant.  I became upset and explained to him that his organization was incompetent and he told me that ""he was the CEO of the company......."" and that ""he didn't have time to deal with this right now"" so to just ""call back another time.""

Is there color printing I can access without much prior notice? On or off campus, closer the better, but the cheaper the better also. I know I can like order printed pages from FedEx but I have no clue how much prior notice they need or how much it costs. Im also kind of surprised those were the only two color printers on campus",https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/crhm4v/color_printers/,Lesp00n,9,2019-08-17 00:36:27,5,/r/OKState/comments/crhm4v/color_printers/
crvo48,New to campus? Here's a few random pieces of advice!,"**Study spots:**

Obviously, there are tons of locations for you to plop down and knock out some homework or reading. I can only list my favorite spots so for all you other non-first years, feel free to add on.

1. Library (obviously...). 4th floor is awesome if you don't mind the people, otherwise 5th floor (super quiet) and basement (can be semi-private).

2. 4th floor student union. Weird choice but there are tons of less-traveled locations. Charging stations, computers (unsure on printers), couches.. 

3. More public / social study areas are your residence halls, 1st &amp; 2nd floor library, Student Union, your College buildings... CASNR has an awesome student area as does SSB. A&amp;S you have to rely more on where your department is. HS and COE are merging but each building has their own awesome spots. CEAT gets lucky and wins (at least I thought so as a student).

**General Tips**

1. Struggling? Seriously, utilize your advisor (or your Director of Student Services for your college). Courses come at your fast when each professor thinks you should spend the most time on *their* course.. Your advisor can be a great tool to point you to tutoring, study groups, or any other resource that is **typically** free. College has all sorts of perks that isn't taken advantage of.

2. [USE THIS SITE](https://registrar.okstate.edu/content/academic-calendar-fall-2019) !! This is your Academic Calendar. Drop dates for 100% refund, 50% refund, W's, are posted here. If you are in a short course, these dates are MUCH quicker. If you aren't sure of your course, please keep in mind you have a brief window to drop it and find a different course. 8am got you napping? Chances are, that coveted 10am course is going to have an opening sometime in the first week to switch into. But the 100% refund date is August 26th, do all your swapping before that day ends. Otherwise, it's a pain in the ass to pay for a course you aren't taking.

3. [ Reboot Center](https://ucs.okstate.edu/reboot/).. Welcome to a very underutilized program. Feeling anxious? Too many things going on at the same time?? Hit up this **FREE** service. It's actually really useful to hit this place up before tests (I think at least).

4. Need a job? Library hires a large amount of students. I don't remember if they are the largest employer of students but it's either #1 or #2 on campus. [Jobs](https://jobs.library.okstate.edu/) for the library are here -- most departments have a student service employer, you just need to find it on the site.

5. Free non-color printing at the library. Tons of computers to use or check out laptops / ipads / cameras / chargers. These items are mostly free to checkout as long as you don't return them late. You can also checkout some books in the library (text books; other books do exist as well though!)

6. You gotta invest your time into your courses. Preaching to the choir here but you need to find your good studying habits. Realize that if you get on top of your course work early, it leaves so much more time to party. I did the stupid thing and partied first, course work 2nd. 

**Town**

1. Sprouts is awesome, Food Pyramid and Walmart have your cheaper groceries. If you can, go to these places. Campus over charges (but meal-plan is allowed so I guess that works out). 

2. Boomer Lake is super close. I'm not sure when they stop renting kayaks out there but that can be a fun weekend thing. It's also 3.2 miles around so if you are 5k training, it works out pretty well.

3. Lake McMurtry and Carl Blackwell are 10-ish minute drives away? 15-minutes? Go fishing, camping, hiking, or disc golf...

4. Disc golf parks -- we got 4: Boomer, Couch (Hoyt), McMurtry, Blackwell. Couch park is down on 12th and Perkins.

5. Dog Park -- 12th and Washington.

6. Iron Monk = local brewery and the best fucking place... Otherwise, the bars on the Strip (Washington) and Stonewall / Stables are your options. 

7. Traffic blows... Be a cautious driver because campus will be fucking nuts, town will be nuts, and you can't trust anyone. Walk or get a bike if you can.

8. Thai Cafe, Nikki's House of Greek, the food trucks you see scattered around campus, food trucks at Iron Monk Tuesday through Saturday -- all great places to eat off-campus.

**Academic Information**

1. Forgot you enrolled in a course and dropped after the deadline? Get sick and had to miss a bunch of class? There's a Petition for a Refund of Tuition and Fees available. It's on the Registrar's website and if you have medical documentation OR you never attended the course, you could be eligible for a refund.

2. Need a transcript? Have registration issues? VA Benefits? 322 Student Union Registrar.

3. Need Bursar? Financial Aid? 1st floor Student Union.

4. Need Tutoring? LASSO Center 021 Classroom Building (basement).

5. Paying Out-of-state Tuition? Get a job in town, take a year off college, and get that in-state tuition rate because holy fuck is it a massive difference. Registrar's site has the Petition for In-State form on it's website as well.
----------

Ultimately, College is what you make it. Don't waste your money if you rather party. Take it seriously and take advantage of everything you are paying for. Advisors, tutoring, [counseling](https://ucs.okstate.edu/), friends / classmates / professors... You have a ton of tools to help you be successful so utilize them.

Check out the various groups and events and join in. Say hi to someone you see a lot because chances are you have a lot in common... Get involved with District Bicycles for their gravel rides (open to anyone). Buy a volleyball and hang out at the various v-ball pits around the halls... Build a planner so you can structure your time effectively...

drqme9,Please go to the Men's Basketball Games this Week! Cade Cunningham and Bryce Thompson are visiting.,"So on Wednesday and Saturday, the men's basketball program has an opportunity to impress two potential Cowboys that will completely change the trajectory of our basketball program. 

Cade Cunningham is the #2 recruit in the class. He's a generational talent. Think Kevin Durant. OSU has an extremely good chance at landing him... And showing what kind of support we could give him would go a long way in that. 

Bryce Thompson is a 5* combo guard from Tulsa and the situation is the same. Choosing between OSU and OU. Let's make sure he knows the obvious choice is the good guys. OU's arena doesn't fill for any basketball games... So this is a chance to differentiate. 

Both guys together would make our team with our coach Final Four contenders. 

So get there early. Be loud. Wear orange. And help these guys make up their minds! 

Go Pokes!

I had applied for Garduation in Fall 2019 and had everything approved and cleared by March 2019. I go to the grad college in person in December to confirm, if everything is okay and they tell me everything is fine and in order. I receive a mail now from the registrar saying my degree requirements are not met and so my degree certificate will not be awarded. I speak to the senior matriculation staff at Grad College who tells me they didn’t receive an email from my advisor and he is the person I need to check with. I am perplexed by this lack of further information and so I mail my advisor who is surprised and also mail another staff at the Graduate College who after repeated mail enquiries tells me that an email list must be sent by the advisor to confirm if everything is in order. I am okay with the process and procedures but had I been told about this email list back in December when I checked with the Grad College as not having been received I would have checked with my advisor to avoid this problem. I really feel the Staff handled my queries in an offhand and cavalier manner. Being an international student, the degree is very important for my job and visa and this lack of concern is disconcerting. I have drafted a mail to the assoc dean and wanted to know from students here if that would be helpful or any advice on how to deal with this.

gc0hx7,PSA: Summer classes are going to be online through recordable mediums so here's how to bust professors committing leftist indoctrination,"Professors are being told to conduct their classes 100% online for the summer semester. Students who feel discriminated and segregated because of their conservative beliefs can report instances where professors promote communism, liberalism and socialism to Campus Reform - a news organization that focuses on higher education.

Leftists masquerading as professors need to know that Campus Reform exists to ensure personal politics isn't used to brainwash susceptible college students. CR has already led several successful campaigns to have such professors fired for knowingly and purposely breaking university rules and regulations. Now more than ever, with the defeat of communist/socialist Bernie Sanders and pipedreams like socialized medicine, liberals have been increasingly antagonistic. Campus Reform takes its mission serious in order to provide everyone with a safe and educational environment free of discrimination and personal agendas

But it is becoming abundantly clear to me that there is no working out the kinks of this shit show of a “in person“ experience they tried to shamble together for us. It’s overtly clear that they are trying to make us pay for fees that they know damn well we will not utilize, because they’ve made them impossible to utilize. I can’t just go speak to my advisor if I have a question. The library removed the doors from the study rooms so now they are worthless, not to mention the table areas are now impossible to study at with others. Most of my teachers can’t actually teach because they have to hide behind a plexiglass shield and I can’t hear them. Some of my teachers aren’t even coming to class they’re just zooming in to a room full of students. And the cherry on top of this scam is that everyone believes that we’re going to end up online anyway, and yet I don’t think they’re going to refund our fees… Just like they didn’t refund our fees last year. I hate that they basically tried to trick us into believing that we were going to have an in person experience, when the reality is it’s a digital experience with an in person twist.

P.S. I firmly believe we should not of come back, we should’ve gone online from the jump… But since they made us come to in person the least they could’ve done was actually make it an in person experience. If we’re going to risk our health and safety we might as well get an education.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/ictwq7/what_are_we_even_doing/,irishnikon,1,2020-08-19 14:57:56,13,/r/OKState/comments/ictwq7/what_are_we_even_doing/
id46j2,DO NOT BUY THE INSURANCE!!,"I am seething with anger right now so I apologize for any language slipping.

We all know the whole “College is a scam” however, because of Covid-19 colleges are scrambling to make as much of a profit as they can from this situation. As many OKstate students know, if you open the Bursar page you are greeted to either accept or deny an insurance through a third person company called GradGuard. Now there is a cancel option and in the description it says to hit cancel to come back later. But as we all know, when that happens we are notified that we MUST make a decision to accept or deny. This causes many to scramble and make a big decision in such a short time. If you accept this, you’ll get an email to finish the insurance. This is where you input your info and pick what semesters to insure. Once you pick your semesters it tells you the Benefits. These state that you’re covered up to 100% for illnesses/ injuries, student’s death, mental health, etc. What is the sketchiest part of this is that there are many links to inform you on COVID-19 LIMITATIONS. None of these links work at all. Each one takes you to an error dispite the WiFi, device, etc. The only thing that mentions Covid is one option from the help bar. Did I also mention that their contact page is an error too? Cause that is also a thing. ANYWAYS, the only thing I found I Covid was the company saying that originally Covid “wasn’t covered” and that for a “limited time” they’ll cover it as a “donation” in these times. It is also mentioned that the time period of Covid coverage is subject to change as well as only certain plans have this coverage. This meaning, they can cut the date and not cover you due to the “situation”. They also evaluate your situation to determine how much you’re refunded. Meaning they can pull any reason out of their ass and deny a refund or a full refund. please don’t buy this insurance. Even if it isn’t much to you, it encourages OSU to pull this behavior. I’ll have pictures soon so if you want some, message me!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/id46j2/do_not_buy_the_insurance/,sneeky_squid,1,2020-08-20 01:07:52,6,/r/OKState/comments/id46j2/do_not_buy_the_insurance/

ih24bc,A lot of talk about the alleged upcoming move to online. Just a few questions.,"Please forgive my ignorance, as I am sure many of these questions may be easily answered. 

First, how certain are we that the university will be moving online? I have been hearing a lot from people on this subreddit and friends that they plan to move us full online sometime soon after the refund drop deadline. 

Second, should we move online, will those in dorms still be living on campus or will they be sent home like last semester?

Third, how is it possible for the university to cancel in person classes yet not provide any form of reimbursement for tuition? The quality of education is clearly lower than it would be should in person classes continue. 

Fourth, would in person resources (i.e library, computer labs, printers etc.) still be accessible if we went full online?

The third question is the most important to me, as it seems completely ridiculous that they would charge us the same yet have a lesser product. This is a public university after all, and being funded in large part by the govt (or indirectly through govt loans), it seems that it would be their duty to either keep the university open or do what is in the best interest of the students, and issue refunds for lost quality.

Our survey gauges college students and on their perceptions of individual privacy and privacy of location and space and how it relates to trust when adopting an institution led digitized contact tracing application.

* You need to be an undergraduate college student at a two-year or four-year college in the United States to be eligible to take the survey.
* This survey will take 10 to 15 minutes to take.
* At the end of the survey is a sign up for optional follow-up interviews that will be led by students of our Analytics and Data Lab.
* Your survey answers remain anonymous outside of the Analytics and Data Lab and will be used internally by us to create a big picture of college students’ point of view on individual location privacy when it comes to a digitized contact tracing application, something that is extremely important in today’s day and age considering the on-going COVID-19 epidemic.

The survey will open September 1st, 2020, and close October 1st, 2020, or when we reach 200 participants.

Please let us know if you have any questions and again thank you so much.

The Writing Center is an awesome place to work, this is my third year there. The pay is $10/hr, and there are a lot of times that you don't have appts, so you basically get paid for doing nothing.

ixy4j5,Non-Credit Student-Led ESL Classes for International Students,"The International &amp; American Student Alliance (IASA) is a student organization at several universities around the US, and we're in the process of becoming established at OSU. One thing that our org does is offer free English as a Second Language (ESL) classes to international students (faculty/staff as well) who want to practice their English skills in a casual environment. Due to COVID-19, all of our classes for Fall 2020 will be virtual, and we've opened them up to international students across all of the universities we're at. So an OSU student could attend one even if it's being led by a student from a different university, and vice-versa. All of these classes are led by current university students wanting to gain teaching experience in a more informal environment.

There are around 30 classes this semester ranging from casual conversation formats to more technical skills-based one like Grammar Skills. All of these classes are starting this week and last for eight weeks.

izzsmi,Free for all rant session,"Opening the post up as a forum to vent about the university, because I’m sure I’m not the only one who is beyond frustrated. This also doesn’t have to be about graduation but because it affected so many people I’m hoping some of y’all will also share your thoughts as well. 



First... genuinely... the administration is a joke. I hope no one in the entire class of 2020 donates a dollar to the university after this year. They have now screwed three groups of graduates out of a ceremony and completely refuse to consider alternative means of having a ceremony that isn’t entirely virtual. The first post on social media about this decision had so much negative feedback that they had to follow it up with an even shittier post about how they could “never come close to meeting CDC guidelines at graduation.”

Really? Then why the hell are we having sports? Especially since we are set to have basketball games in that same arena at the same time too. Even considering the sparse basketball attendance over the last few years, that’s still plenty of people in a closed environment. If that’s safe, why isn’t this?

“People will come from out of town.” Oh yeah? You mean like they do for football? Or like they do every weekend when students come back from weekend trips/visiting friends and family/going out to bars? 

They have so much time to plan something out but they refuse to because apparently years of tuition from thousands of students just wasn’t enough. People are actually coming up with some incredible plans for dividing up graduations and making only certain aspects virtual and providing ways for photographs to happen and minimizing contact between people and surfaces as much as possible. The university probably hasn’t even read a single comment. If they had, their response wouldn’t have been “We can’t, and we don’t care to try.” 

If you feel so inclined, speak up. Email and call. Sign that petition that’s floating around. And seriously... when you get that call asking for alumni donations about a month after you graduate, remember this. Remember that this school doesn’t hold your education in a higher regard than sporting events. Remember that all the money you’ve spent so far didn’t even get you the finality of walking across a stage for 10 seconds in front of your friends, family, and peers because it was just way too impossible for the administration to consider. 

Class of 2020 or not... remember this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/izzsmi/free_for_all_rant_session/,TheExcelMaster,1,2020-09-26 01:03:57,15,/r/OKState/comments/izzsmi/free_for_all_rant_session/

Hi guys - back in July, I posted a survey about the coronavirus on various college subs. I got almost 500 responses and recently wrote an article summarizing the findings. There were so many excellent responses it was hard to pick which ones to highlight, but I tried my best to capture the trends I observed. Since a good chunk of the responses came from students in this sub, I thought I’d make an update post (all in all, I’d say about 25 universities had high levels of representation in the survey, so I’ll be making update posts in those particular subs).  

Thanks so much to the people in this sub who participated! This wouldn’t have been possible without the help of student redditors. If any of you have questions, feel free to PM me.

j7f21v,We should be given the option to pass/no pass again.,"I can't be the only one who wants this.
The whole reason we got the option in the Spring is because it was a way to offset the unfairness of the class format being changed unexpectedly.
However, the same thing happened again this semester. The university had almost no transparency about what to expect leading up to the semester, and now most classes have changed in some fashion.
All of my classes were originally scheduled to be in person.
All of them are now online. 
How is this any different from what happened in the Spring?
To make matters worse, my professors refuse to adapt. They write full-length exams and expect them to be completed in 50 minutes, but I have to stop after 35 minutes to ensure that I have enough time to take pictures, transfer pictures from phone to computer, resize pictures, convert pictures to pdf, and then upload. 
It feels like the only reason they aren't doing p/np again is simply because they don't want to do it twice.

jgcexl,Open Letter to OSU (Gauging Interest and Asking for Input),"I'm a prof at OSU. I'm working on an open letter to the University about their awful response to the pandemic, among a few other things. My students are suffering profoundly. I have a draft written, which I'll paste below. If anyone has anything you want added, please let me know. I will revise and post this on [Change.org](https://Change.org), as well as sending around for other faculty to sign.  


&gt; Despite promises from the administration, students at Oklahoma State University (OSU) are suffering greatly.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently, there are several issues going unaddressed.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;First, OSU has refused, despite pleas from students, to implement a Pass/Fail option for Fall 2020. We feel that there is no justifiable reason to refuse to allow a Pass/Fail option. Citing ""academic integrity"" (as VP of Student Affairs Doug Hallenbeck has) and negative impact on scholarships, transfers and applications to jobs or further schooling is insufficient justification for several reasons. (1) A Pass/Fail option is optional, and only affects students who freely choose it. (2) Scholarships, applications and academic integrity are not nearly as valuable as student well-being. (3) There are no clear or definite reasons to think that applications to jobs or educational programs would be significantly affected by some students taking a Pass/Fail grade; educational institutions and employers should understand that COVID-19 has caused widespread suffering and adjust their expectations accordingly. Finally, a petition for a Pass/Fail grading option has received over 6,000 signatures as of Oct. 22, 2020, which is roughly 1/4th of all students at OSU.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.ocolly.com/news/petition-for-pass-no-pass-grading/article\_5fc2ba46-02ca-11eb-b8a7-e7cbfa49f1d2.html](https://www.ocolly.com/news/petition-for-pass-no-pass-grading/article_5fc2ba46-02ca-11eb-b8a7-e7cbfa49f1d2.html)  
[https://ktul.com/news/local/3-osu-students-take-their-own-lives-students-want-change](https://ktul.com/news/local/3-osu-students-take-their-own-lives-students-want-change)  
[https://www.change.org/p/oklahoma-state-university-change-osu-grading-policy-to-pass-fail-for-fall-2020?signed=true](https://www.change.org/p/oklahoma-state-university-change-osu-grading-policy-to-pass-fail-for-fall-2020?signed=true)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, OSU COVID guidelines are (a) insufficient to protect students and (b) not well enforced nor implemented. Additionally, (c) OSU has not made health-services widely available and accessible to students sick with COVID-19. (a) Current OSU guidelines are insufficient in that students are allowed to return to dorms while still symptomatic, and the criteria for return to dorms is far too vague and subjective to be useful. Current OSU criteria for return to campus is 10 days from start of symptoms, improvement in symptoms, and lack of fever. However, due to the inherent difficulty of gauging one's own improvement, and the unpredictability of COVID-19 progression, this leaves too much up to fallible student judgement, and puts roommates, students and faculty/staff at risk. (b) Further, it is not clear that there is any detailed contact-tracing on campus. There appears to be symptomatic students, who are likely still contagious, returning to campus and shared-living spaces. (b) Additionally, there are reports from students who have tested positive for COVID-19, or who have had a roommate test positive for COVID-19, and been refused aid from the university. One student in particular claimed that ""when my studio was affected by COVID, the university left us on our own."" Though the university has promised to arrange separate rooms for those who test positive, this is not always happening. Currently, though the CDC and University recommendations are aligned, the University should be playing it safe and not allowing students to return to campus housing nor in-person classes without medical evaluation or further testing. Especially since OSU faculty/staff and students are not notified of positive test results. (c) Multiple students have reported to faculty that, once quarantined for a positive COVID-19 test, University Health Services (UHS) have not reached out to them to check on their symptoms. Further, multiple students have reported to faculty that, though they were significantly ill, they were not advised on how/where to seek treatment, and that, upon calling UHS, they were not able to get a prompt virtual appointment. This is especially scary for students who are not from the area, as they have no established physician in Stillwater, and because the Stillwater Hospital is currently at or near COVID ICU capacity as of Oct. 15th, 2020.

[https://www.stillwater-medical.org/node/737](https://www.stillwater-medical.org/node/737)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Third, OSU failed to prepare for the predictable mental health crises on campus. Currently, OSU mental health services is backed up, and appointments are booked out as far as 6 months (according to students who self-reported to faculty). An alarmingly high number of students are reporting suicidal thoughts or inclination to self-harm to faculty members. OSU has stated that, though there is a long wait for counseling appointments, students in urgent need of a counselor will be seen quickly. However,  students have reported to faculty that, upon calling University Counseling Services, they have been shrugged off, or simply told to seek help by calling the suicide prevention hotline. It appears that students are not receiving the help they need, and that the University is not directing them to substantive mental health care outside of the university. Again, this was an entirely predictable turn of events, and OSU had plenty of time to prepare for it.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Between 3 and 4 OSU students have committed suicide since August 2020. Initial reports were of 3 suicides since August 2020, however, multiple students have reported an additional suicide to faculty which is going unreported.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://ucs.okstate.edu/scc/index.html](https://ucs.okstate.edu/scc/index.html)  
[https://ktul.com/news/local/3-osu-students-take-their-own-lives-students-want-change](https://ktul.com/news/local/3-osu-students-take-their-own-lives-students-want-change)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Fourth, OSU Safety's Twitter account (@OkstateSafety) tweeted out news that two OSU students had stolen a Trump 2020 from someone's lawn, assuring the community that an investigation was under-way (Oct 21st 9:47am). Immediately, these two students had names and addresses leaked by people commenting. Threats to these students were made, and verbal abuse hurled at them. Though several OSU students and faculty asked OSU Safety to take down this tweet or disable comments to protect these students, OSU Safety left this tweet up until the next day (afternoon of Oct. 22nd), enough time to allow the identity and personal information of these students to be widespread. In today's hostile political climate, this certainly endangered the well-being of these students. Given that OSU has not prioritized student well-being, this endangerment of students is a disgusting and disgraceful act by OSU as an institution.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Demands:  
(1) OSU needs to tighten rules for returning to campus, ensuring that symptomatic students cannot return without medical screening by a doctor and negative COVID-19 test.  
(2) OSU needs to tighten contact tracing, so that no symptomatic students slip through the cracks.  
(3) OSU needs to alert faculty and classmates of COVID-positive students prior to that student returning to campus, if the student showed symptoms, and especially if the student was still symptomatic.  
(4) OSU needs to make mental-health care available to all students. Perhaps the University ought to ensure all students access to free Better Help services (at the very least), or contract with counselors outside of the University.  
(5) OSU Safety needs to publicly apologize for the students above for allowing their personal information to leak, and commit to this never happening again.  
(6) OSU needs to implement a Pass/No-Pass grading option for Fall 2020, and likely for Spring 2021.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/jgcexl/open_letter_to_osu_gauging_interest_and_asking/,Nickleback769,1,2020-10-22 20:37:22,64,/r/OKState/comments/jgcexl/open_letter_to_osu_gauging_interest_and_asking/

Outside of Oklahoma nobody even knows Spears and the fact that they're letting you enroll in the MBA straight out of undergrad is already sketchy. Majority of these MBAs go work in jobs they could've got in undergrad.  DONT LET YOUR ADVISOR SCAM YOU BY SUGGESTING THIS DEGREE

MBAs are for people looking to make a career switch and generally are suitable after a few years of work exp. Nobody really opts for an MBA to actually learn about business and most of the post MBA jobs require 3-4 years of work experience.

kdacrj,Need a Stillwater apartment for the coming semester?,"I need someone to takeover my lease at the Reserve on Perkins for this coming spring semester. 

Looking for a male around college age.

The rent is $405/month

The apartment is a 4 bed and 4 bath apartment with a common area and kitchen. All the appliances are included (washer, dryer, dishwasher, oven, stove, etc.) The monthly bill covers the utilities. And you only need to worry about your own bill. The bill will NOT be split between your roommates.

It is a four person apartment, the three other rooms are already filled. The current roommates are pretty chill and aren’t loud. I haven’t had any problems with them.

The apartment is a 5 minute drive to the north silver commuter lots on campus.

The lease will last until July, then you can get it renewed or move out. 

The average 4x4 apartment at the Reserve on Perkins will start at around $500 per month, so this is a pretty good deal for just moving in.

To move in, all you’ll need to do is fill out the application from the leasing office and probably get insurance for it, then you’ll be set.

If you or someone you know is interested or has questions, please DM me and we can get it set up.

I will he moved out of the apartment in the coming days so it will be available pretty quick.

I am personally supporting candidate Jack Edwards and his VP Alex Bias. Jack is a kind and caring man who seeks to make SGA what it is always meant to be, a tool for serving the students.

Last semester alone Jack passed 8 bills to help concerns that he heard from students. The biggest one that you can feel the impact of are Wellness Days! Yes, he passed the legislation about wellness days. 

I would love it if you guys voted today! Even if you don't vote for Edwards-Bias, as Jack would say, ""What really matters is that people's voices be heard!"" If you want to vote, follow the link below to find the voting form!

I'm not a student at this University (I'm from the Caribbean and attend a University within my country), and as such cannot access it myself. 

I'm extremely sorry if this is a weird ask or overstepping, but I'm currently doing a lab (The Effect of Temperature on The Metabolic Rate of an Endotherm) for my course Physiology of Animals and I do believe the paper will provide me with a more nuanced sense of the topics at hand, as well as their applications.

m5q61l,Thoughts on Jim Knowles,"So if you've been keeping your eye on football recruiting lately, you may have seen that OSU managed to crack the top 10 in recruiting classes. Yeah, yeah, I know it's not gonna last. But the more important thing to note is that we've recruited some real studs on defense.

What is the long term for Jim Knowles? Can we expect him to stay a while as DC? Could we be looking to him to replace Gundy at some point? In any case, he's been doing something really special here with our defense. I was worried before about losing our stars in our secondary but he's doing something we don't do here a lot. He's reloading.

What do you guys think? Was this last season a one off for our defense or do you think Knowles has adjusted to the high octane Big XII style of play? Do you think he'll stay or will he get snatched up by a school with more money?",https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/m5q61l/thoughts_on_jim_knowles/,MadHotLad,1,2021-03-15 13:37:53,1,/r/OKState/comments/m5q61l/thoughts_on_jim_knowles/

mgra3l,Questions about moving to Stillwater,"Hi everyone,

I've been accepted to OK State as a grad student and will likely attend. I just have a few questions about housing:

When should I plan on securing housing? I hear earlier in the summer is better, since the market won't already be slammed with other students. I'm hoping to start searching in mid-June to lock down a place by July 15 -- should I start sooner?

Also, I want to try and do virtual tours if possible, since I'm currently halfway across the country. Can anyone share their experiences, positive or negative, with searching from a distance?

Additional context, if needed: I won't be earning a lot, so I'm hoping to go as cheap as possible without getting axe-murdered. That likely means I'll rent a room in a house or apartment. I live alone and have basically no stipulations.

I'll probably have more questions in the weeks to come, but for now, thank you all in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/mgra3l/questions_about_moving_to_stillwater/,Secret-Lawfulness725,1,2021-03-30 18:07:25,13,/r/OKState/comments/mgra3l/questions_about_moving_to_stillwater/

ms8w9p,Looking for someone to take over my lease at Avenue East Apartments,"I need to someone to take over my lease for Fall 2021 - 2022. Rent is fairly cheap, at \~$400 per month,  and you only have to pay for your room, without worrying about housemates paying theirs!The lease also  comes with a Best Value Guarantee, which means any and all deals Avenue East is running will apply when you take over! 

The place comes with free parking, a washer-dryer unit, your own bathroom, and amenities are a package deal (and it's really cheap, \~$40 a month for gas, electric, water, internet, etc.). Avenue East is right on Hall of Fall Ave, and right next to Wal-Mart and a bus stop, so you have a lot of shopping nearby. The drive to campus takes about 5 minutes. 

I currently have 2 housemates, but one will be leaving this year, and the other will be leaving after Fall semester. So the place will be pretty empty, and you could bring a friend to room with you!

mtjhxm,Questions from incoming OSU Grad Student,"Hey everyone! I'm graduating with my BA next week and will be heading to OSU in the fall for my masters! I'm so excited to move to Stillwater and meet everyone! I have a few questions about Stillwater and grad student life, so if you have any advice please let me know:

1. My current town is very walkable, I walk to campus, the grocery store, work, etc. and there's free public transport for students to get around so I have never needed a car. Do I need a car for life in Stillwater? Is there good public transport? Or would a bike maybe be sufficient? 
2. With that first question, since I don't have a car do students need to leave town much? I live pretty frugally but if I need to furnish an apartment or something do I have to drive to Tulsa or Oklahoma City? 
3. Are there places to live just for grad students? I'm 24 and it's nice to live with people your own age in similar situations. I know there's a grad complex on campus but it's pretty expensive for my budget, so does anyone know other places for grad students?
4. What do folks in Stillwater do for fun? I'm not a huge bar person and I'm kinda ambivalent about sports, what other places in the community do students get together and have a good time? 

If you have any other ideas of things incoming students should know, I would love to hear it!

mzuacj,I created a large student survey last summer (450 redditors participated) and am back with survey #2,"If you check my post history you'll see that I circulated a student survey last summer across various college subreddits. About 450 students participated, and the survey data was written up in a [Medium Piece](https://medium.com/@liviamorris/i-feel-that-the-future-ive-been-working-towards-my-whole-life-is-gone-now-what-students-have-b33e5d09456b?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ef9ef45585d8c9c8aff6eaa007cd09d3).

Now that we've been in the pandemic for over a year, I'd love to get your guys' feedback once again. The first survey was largely about the difficulties of adjusting to the pandemic, while this one is focused more on how the pandemic has impacted mental health and mentorship, as well as whether you feel that your campus is supportive of students who want to pursue independent projects (e.g. startups, creative endeavors, on-campus initiatives, etc.). All responses are anonymous (no personal info is collected) and you can opt whether to have your responses included in the write-up. 

If anyone has questions, please feel free to ask. And if anyone wants a copy of the raw data when it's ready, PM me and I'll add your name to the list. 

Thanks so much - and good luck with midterms/finals!

I am also a legacy of one fraternity at OSU, but I don’t know that I would fit in well there.

1. How hard is it to get decent scholarships for less-popular destinations?

I also heard from her cousin that he was caught having relations with a 13 year old but the parents had decided to not press charges.

obf88k,"Any young solo travelers out there or am I the only one? If I am not, please share! I love to hear stories.","Hi, ya'll:

I am a young, solo, early-twenties male traveler who happens to be a student and entrepreneur at the same time. I am interested in hearing stories and experiences from other solo traveling students around campus who were able to fund their trips. 

For me, I have been in many countries and the majority of US states.

Some interesting experiences: 

1. I couchsurfed my friend's farm in the Amazonian Rainforest. The kids in the village I was couchsurfing spoke no Spanish and only spoke a language called Kichwa, which is a language native to the Amazon. 

2. I have went to some dangerous cities in Latin America. One time, I took the bus to this city called Acapulco in Mexico, got off the bus and it was pitch dark. I tried to call an Uber to avoid getting scammed or kidnapped, but Uber wasn't available in that city. So, I decided to get a taxi. I found a taxi driver. The taxi driver told me that it is dangerous in the city, and there are mafia in the city and to get into the car with him. I decided to get into the car naively. We immediately started driving and he kept stopping in sketchy alley ways. I usually am really down to earth; however, this made me go: ""What in the world is this guy trying to do here?"". As a result of this thought, I decided to keep my guard up. Finally, we reached our destination, I tried to give him a 20 dollar bill, but gave him 2 20 dollar bills that happened to be physically stuck together on accident. I realized that and asked for 30$ change. He gave me the change I requested, but it was all counterfeit money.

3. I have seen sharks, lion fish, octopus and many more animals when snorkeling around the world.

Some ways I fund my trips:

1. My jobs.
2. Setting a tight budget on expenses.
3. Becoming very money oriented while in school. 
4. Finding multiple side hustles, and always figuring out ways to turn my hobbies into cash.
5. Working my tail off, and investing my tail off.

If any of you have cool stories and ways you funded your trips, please share!

To keep it brief, I got caught on campus with alcohol the guys and I were just sipping on. Freshman, 18YO, etc. We were quiet, not drinking to get drunk, and about to go to bed. We were stupid to do so and just got unlucky. I was honest and let them know what I did, no lying or hiding anything. I don’t think I’ve ever learned from a mistake so quickly, was scared shitless. 

I know I have to talk with a board. Question is—has anyone been through something similar? I’m curious about what I’ll have to do. I was accepted into the aviation program and am quite honestly terrified about the potential consequences there.

osuojs,Student loan assistance - public loan providers for OK state,"Hello all,

I'm on mobile, apologies for grammar amd spelling mistakes.

I am attempting to locate some information for student loan providers for when my family member goes to OSU this fall. Ideally I'm looking for public loans offered by the state or really any agency that is not private.


Essentially the parents refuse to provide financial assistance, including parent plus loans. Financial aid will not cover roughly 20K. I have found information about OSLA and when consulting the student financial aid office my family member was informed that the FA staff could not provide any further information, and they did not confirm if OSLA was a public or private option.  I'll be calling OSLA tomorrow, but hoping maybe someone here had more information.

The parents would cosign loans that are not parent plus loans.  I have briefly looked at seeing if my family member could apply for financial emancipation and qualify for more from FAFSA, but I'm afraid I do not understand the finer details.  So if someone has info on that it would also be helpful.

I am aware of private loan providers, but hoping to avoid them if at all possible.  


If you need more details, I've got more concrete numbers below.

Out of state student tuition + room and board + college fees comes to about 44k

Scholarships total 19k 

Federal loans offered under FAFSA total 5.5k total

Loan amount needed is 20k


Many thanks in advance for everyone's time, I (and by extension, my family member) really appreciate it.  If you have further questions I will be happy to respond.

p7vgzi,A trainwreck in slow motion,"Sophomore here who never got the standard freshman experience and has only known OSU with masks and sparsely packed rooms until this semester.  While I was excited this summer to hear that things would for the most part be returning to normal, with recent news I am fearful that administration might have jumped the gun. COVID numbers are essentially exponentially increasing in the south and around the US as a whole, with Oklahoma too seeing some of its highest daily new cases numbers across the entire pandemic.  

I was not surprised to see the absence of mask mandates on campus, as I am aware of our governor’s banning of mask mandates for public universities and schools in his infinite wisdom. But, what did surprise me was the utter lack of any social distancing in classes. A multitude of students packed nearly shoulder to shoulder in many of mine with the only precautions being a primitive version of contact tracing relying on professors spending class time on dragging students to their seat positions in Canvas. A couple of months ago we would have called such things “super spreader events”, but I guess there is no time for caution when the university has already extended its word on a return to normalcy. I have already heard from some professors that they are aware that new cases among students are spiking. 

And there’s not to mention the “recommendation” for mask-wearing, of which I’ve seen maybe 5% maximum of students in my classes actually wearing. I would hope that when OSU recommended mask wearing they would be aware that as is common among college students, if something is optional, the utter majority will opt not to participate. 

I applaud OSU’s incentives with the Poke-a-thon campaign, but among the sizable demographic on campus who will refuse vaccinations at whatever cost, such promotions (in my opinion) seem to be preaching to the choir who already have been vaccinated. 

I don’t mean to be pessimistic, but in my view these upcoming months hold little other than a looming delta wave that will overtake OSU and Oklahoma schools in general with worse numbers than previous peak pandemic (if current Florida and texas are anything to judge by). I am fully vaccinated so I don’t hold many concerns for myself.

pat91e,Feelings on the Mask (Non)Mandate,"As someone who's followed the rules and believes in the effectiveness of masks, this new ""Expected"" rule is a dumpster fire that I can only see getting worse. From what I've seen, a generous 20% of all the people I've seen today indoors are wearing masks, and it was closer to 5% for the first week we were on campus. This is going to do nothing to slow down the delta variant.

Nothing short of expelling students is going to work for enforcing masks, so why bother with the expectation nonsense anyways besides to make the stakeholders happy?. It's already too late anyways, we've had a week of people interacting freely like OSU promised in the summer to spread covid. I'm still going to wear my mask, but that's cause I feel it's the right thing to do and it doesn't bother me the way it does others.

pwaaxu,Transfer Admission,"Howdy, I am very interested in Ok State but have a few concerns with getting accepted. Alright so, these posts are annoying so I’ll keep it brief. 

I was at Texas Tech for 3 years, was absolutely miserable until the last year and was kind of a loser. I had a lot of personal issues and ended up being academically suspended with 102 credits to my name (includes pass and fail) and a 1.8 Cum. GPA. 

Realized I had work to do on myself, enlisted in the army. Go to Korea and enroll in University of Maryland Global, get a 4.0 GPA on my first 10 credits, which boosts my gpa to a 2.02 cum. 

I still have a near full calendar year until I can submit my application to the school but as a worrier and a perpetual planner, I would like a bit of advice as where to set my expectations of admittance. For what it’s worth I’m wanting to go into the Microbiology Major.

We have seen students with brand new computers, lose all of their information, because the bitlocker recovery was triggered, and they did not have the key file saved.

qv2k60,Lease Takeover - Spring 2022,"Hey I just want to put this out there, I'm looking for someone to take over my lease in January, at Prime Place 312 W Elm by campus! 


It's a 4B4B + common area and kitchen shared with 3 other guys, they're pretty cool. Very nice and easygoing roommates, and good people. I know roommates can be a nightmare scenario when they're bad but I don't see that happening with this bunch. It's spacious, comfortable, nice appliances, and utilities are included!

It's in the newest Prime Place building, near the entrance on the first floor (in my opinion one of the best spots in the complex, maybe I'm biased). From what house hunting I did a year ago, I think the value is great, I haven't had any issues that weren't very easy to resolve with maintenance, and I would keep living here if I weren't planning to move out of Stillwater. I think it's really nice relative to what apartments I looked at in the area, but compared to the dorms it's significantly better and cheaper.


I would encourage you if you're thinking about it to leave a comment with a general question or shoot me a direct message if you'd like my contact info and the sort. I would be more than happy to set up a tour or send photos. If you know anyone else who might be interested, send them my way!

r51het,Okay real question: how does counseling help?,"(Sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile and an abundance of caffeine. Let me know if yall have any questions. I just don't know who to ask about this, as none of my close friends go to counseling.) 


I'm going to be honest, I don't see the value. 

I know I'm depressed and have some form of anxiety. ADHD or autism is still up for debate. I know I need help but I don't know if it will actually help. I know it's not going to be instant or a quick fix. Getting help for mental health is incredibly daunting.


As some background on myself, I've been trying to get actual help on and off for the past few months. I did an intake appointment with University counseling (which was rough, ngl) only to be told they have no availability. After that, I stopped trying for a bit.  Then, about a month after that, I went to the university clinic and got a 5 mg prescription of Lexapro (I almost cancelled that appointment a couple times). 

I stopped taking the medication after 3 weeks because I didn't feel any different and I didn't reach out to counseling services like I told the doctor I would. I didn't want to show up to my doctor's appointment and be like, ""hey bestie, you know the thing I said I was going to do? Well I didn't because I psyched myself out of it. Maybe I'm faking it. Maybe it's because I hate disappointing people. Maybe it's Maybelline. ""

I recently got a girlfriend, who had a toxic ex before, and I'm trying to be better for myself, my friends, and her. I have supportive friends, my first girlfriend, and I have an internship for next semester.  On paper, my life is doing well considering everything, but I don't  think I can make it another semester. 

So to get back to the original point of this long rant, what's the point? 

I'm at a lost here. I want to get help, but I also have to be pragmatic. I don't have the time to sort myself out.  I'm a junior in engineering, I can't just take the day off. I'm terrified that the only thing I'll get out of counseling is becoming more self aware, which I'm not sure is a good thing. After all, what's so bad about ignoring all your problems? /s


I've already cut out my parents, I ignore all of my problems, and my only pressing issues are school. So what is talking about it going to help? My professors don't care, especially at the end of the semester. It's too late to make any actual difference in my grades.

_---------------_

TLDR: I want to get counseling, but I'm afraid it's not actually going to help. What's your experience with counseling and how has it affected you?

rak6pe,[QUESTION] Would OKState students use an app that lets you study together with other students via silent video calls?,"I’m a London-based Master’s student who currently finds it difficult concentrating for longer periods of time and finding daily motivation. I’m normally very organised, have the will to learn and the desire to achieve good grades (scored a 1st/5.0 GPA in my BSc). But the remote-learning environment due to COVID-19 decreases my accountability, productivity and makes me feel socially isolated.

The idea would be to:

1. Match verified students (i.e. you sign up with your university e-mail) on a video call
2. Study silently side-by-side (on mute) by leaving video running in the background 
3. Finish the study session

ret4o0,The Futurist Society at Oklahoma State," 

Hello everyone!

My name is Damian, and I'm an aerospace engineering student at UC Irvine. I've created a club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We talk about flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We also have plans to start doing projects as our org gets more established.

This post is being made on behalf of our Oklahoma State chapter, which is in the process of forming. We have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! If you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!

ropa2q,Prime Place 312 Lease Takeover ASAP,"Hey everyone, this is a repeat post (hopefully doesn't get removed!) but I am seeking anyone who would be interested to take over my lease at Prime Place 312.


It's a 4B4B + common area and kitchen shared with 3 other guys, they're pretty cool. Very nice and easygoing roommates, and good people. I know roommates can be a nightmare scenario when they're bad but I don't see that happening with this bunch.

It's in the newest Prime Place building, near the entrance on the first floor (in my opinion one of the best spots in the complex, maybe I'm biased). From what house hunting I did a year ago, I think the value is great, I haven't had any issues that weren't very easy to resolve with maintenance, and I would keep living here if I weren't planning to move out of Stillwater. I think it's really nice relative to what apartments I looked at in the area, but compared to the dorms it's significantly better and cheaper. It's spacious, comfortable, nice appliances, and utilities are included! You can also walk to campus!


I would encourage you if you're thinking about it to leave a comment with a general question or shoot me a direct message if you'd like my contact info and the sort. I would be more than happy to set up a tour or send photos. If you know anyone else who might be interested, send them my way!

I am from the Upper Midwest and am almost ready to put money down for Oklahoma State but still have a few questions.

1. I am a Plant and Soil Sciences Major, wondering what kind of jobs and where a lot of Ag kids work after college, is it only in Oklahoma or are students competitive with large/ out of state companies?
2. I am interested in joining a fraternity next year and got the impression that OK State has a more chillaxed Greek Life compared to other schools in the Big-12. Am I wrong with this assumption or is there fraternities who are not insane with the partying (if you could give some names of some that would be awesome!).
3. I have heard somethings about campus and Stillwater totally shutting down when it’s not a football weekend. Is it true that everybody goes home or is there enough going on with kids on campus to have some fun. 

I know everyone doesn’t have an answer to every question but if you’re able to contribute a little bit that would be super helpful.

td14l5,The Quarters at Stillwater - Don't Lease!,"With students renewing leases or signing new ones, I wanted to warn y'all about The Quarters.

Why I originally leased with them: 
- they were the cheapest I could get for only a 2br/2ba
- it was an individual lease
- it was the best I could do for never having the chance to visit Stillwater before starting my program.

Why you should not lease here: 
- party central
- dirty common areas
- pool has plumbing issues
- cockroaches occasionally (see my profile for proof)
- maintenance is either unpaid or doesn't care
- maintenance has lied about spraying for bugs (at least one instance where they announced themselves, said they would spray, did not spray, and left after less than 30 sec of being in the apt)
- stained carpets/floors
- filthy hallways
- residents break doors all the time
- ""secured access"" door to the hallways frequently have broken locks, so you can either let anyone in or they don't open
- Dog piss in the hallways
- Piles of dog poop just left around outside
- the parking lots fill up during parties, but the office staff can't be helped to get rid of non-resident vehicles
- the office staff push smoothie/tea/shake shops that are fronts for Herbalife, a known multi level marketing scheme
- I've witnessed the office staff lie to potential residents about including ""renters insurance"". The $12 monthly fee is not renters insurance, it's a liability waiver
- Did I say the hallways are filthy? Because they're filthy. There's literally pizza smeared on my floor's hallway walls, and it's been there since December

I can't wait until I leave in May so I can write a review on this shithole.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/td14l5/the_quarters_at_stillwater_dont_lease/,Ranger_Hardass,1,2022-03-13 01:49:29,9,/r/OKState/comments/td14l5/the_quarters_at_stillwater_dont_lease/

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/okstate) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking.

Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add.

Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.

u0otr6,Am I the only one who thinks O'Brate is overrated as a stadium?,"My wife and I went to O'Brate for the first time last night - we moved in from out of state last year. We have no school allegiance either way so this is not trash OSU post. I was really, really anticipating the game and seeing the venue but came away with a sour experience.

1) The general admission seats in the outfield are extremely uncomfortable to sit on for the duration of a baseball game. These aren't even seats. They're spots on concrete benches with no back support at all, not what we were expecting. We thought there were backs that extend across the row, like at the College World Series stadium in Omaha. It got pretty uncomfortable quickly. 

2) For what's supposed to be a great stadium, there should be actual seats in the outfield. But *at least* aluminum bleachers with backs that extend across the row, like the small sections deep down the foul line.

3) We sat near the centerfield batter's eye and lost track of a homerun hit because the way the stadium was built in centerfield obscured views of the balls hit to the section on the other side of it.

4) Orange chairback seats are almost impossible to get at anything resembling fair prices. Why is that? We can get really good seats at Oklahoma City Dodgers games - a much higher level of baseball - for less to far less than a chairback at O'Brate. No issues getting chairbacks in Norman, either. We looked at the TCU game in Stillwater in a couple weeks - only actual seats are resellers asking $100+.  Seats behind home plate are $31 for the Dodgers. Also looked at the Texas Tech game in May - no chairbacks available at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/u0otr6/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_obrate_is_overrated/,knick90,1,2022-04-10 15:20:46,0,/r/OKState/comments/u0otr6/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_obrate_is_overrated/

v7a78j,Math Placement Exam - should I be worried?,"Right, so this is the most embarrassing moment of my life.

I’m not the best at math. I’m going to OSU and my major is communications for the arts and sciences, stuff that would never need complicated math in its classes. So I wasn’t too worried about my time here, I have a 32 on the ACT for reading and English, and that’s really all I need to get the classes I need. 

Unfortunately, I absolutely bombed the math placement exam. Thanks to COVID my incompetent, backwards ass southern Oklahoma school essentially gave up on teaching me math. I haven’t really learned anything new since early 2020. Because of this, im at a sizeable disadvantage in the math department. Not only because I suck at it, but my own lack of opportunities to learn more.

Point is, life sucks right now because I got a fucking 18 on the math placement exam. I got a 30 in practice exams, but some neurons in my brain decided to immediately commit suicide. I’m completely ashamed and my orientation is in a few days, no time for retakes. So, all that’s left is to assess the damage. 

I’m guessing I can take a remedial class of some sort, which is fine by me. I don’t mind taking a few extra classes. I just hope this doesn’t mess with my plans, I was accepted into the Honors College and I was valedictorian of my class now. This is a massive hit to my honor AND my ego.

vd2585,The Futurist Society," 

Hello everyone!

I've created a national student club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We discuss flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We are building a Wiki of many types of future tech as a resource for people looking to know more about technology. We also have plans to start doing projects as our organization gets more established. We also have guest talks from speakers who work in tech!

Right now there is no chapter being formed at this school, but we are always looking for people to help us start new ones for the next school year! Being one of our leaders could be a great opportunity in shaping your resume and in making connections! We also welcome anyone who just wants to join for our discussions.

We have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! If you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!

w90wma,Creating a successful resume,"This is a throw away account just to post this.  

First off, right off the bat, I must say I am not selling anything and I certainly don't want any contact info. I just wanted to share (see below google drive link of *free* resume/cover letter and interview tactics files) what I learned from one year of job searching and going through the daily, arduous ordeal that is crafting resumes and networking online.

This is the exact process for how I landed a role, finally, with a job I like.

Just in time for graduation and/or summer break :)

Whether looking for an internship, your first career job, or *actually* good tips for interview tactics, this guide and embedded files are something I wish I had when I was in university and on the job hunt.

Because let's be honest, in all our schooling, NO ONE EVER TAUGHT US HOW TO DO THIS AND IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT! Am I right?? Yeeesh.

Anyways, below is the resource-filled link and practical advise that is an accumulation of all my personal research and assistance from job coaches ($1500 total spent there, yikes!), and the resumes I edited for my colleagues (once I figured out the formula), complete with notes on how you can do it, too.

(They all got jobs as a result, btw. One friend, I kid you not, had zero interviews in 6 months then had 3 in one week after following this ressume formula and other methods. Could have been a fluke, but I'm just saying this method works. No promises of course, but its genuine).

It details how I got recruiters' attention, networked online with people who had the role I dreamed of, and, most importantly, includes a *jaw-dropping* resume/cover letter format, as well as interview tactics, cold outreach email templates, and modules that someone sent me that contain practical tips and tricks for how to get that coveted role:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM\_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZyeVUqJ69NmHD-w3-Jt15D4HmTOybM_)

It's my goal to help ease the anxiety and stress of this process for all those students who may be actively or passively looking for a job and need help standing out from the pack.

As mentioned earlier, trust this oft-rejected fool that this resume format is *perfect*. I know this because I tried many, many other formats and this one was the one that landed me and my colleagues roles *much* quicker and added a ""WOW"" factor to it.

**Some additional notes on resumes:**

1. Usually keep it to one page.
2. Keep the format and font the same as these examples; just put in your information. I included other CVs to showcase a variety of roles/careers. I think there is some formatting errors on a couple resumes, but you can fix those. I saved them as Word files so they are editable. :)
3. Believe me when I say numbers mean everything in a resume, no matter the industry. So put them on as many bullet points as you can. Hiring managers *love* that. Which is better? ""responsible for managing team and hosting meetings"" or ""managed team of 20 coworkers, whose combined sales reached 112% quota"" See what I'm sayin?
4. Keep this bullet point format: Past tense verb (created, developed, etc) ---&gt; number ---- result number. Every bullet point, or as many as possible. Search resume verbs in google for ideas, or use the ones in the resumes provided.
5. Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? Just want to hammer that home. As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the ""vague description"" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this, in my experience, and the resume will never get looked at, I can darn near 100% promise that.
6. Inverted pyramid style: Chronological order, most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order. This looks good visually and they mostly care about what you did most recently anyways.
7. Write a *bad ass* description of the company you worked for, right under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just *what* that company does, if it isn't obvious.  
This is *KEY!*  
Ex: ""Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America."" See how much better that is than just the name? You feel the difference?
8. Numbers below ten, spell out. All others just write the number. Instead of exact numbers, when they get too big, write a ""+ after the rounded number (ex: ""157 employees ---&gt; ""150+ employees"") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital ""K"" for thousand, ""M"" for million (ex: $23,800 ----&gt; $23K+; $5 million ---&gt; $5M)
9. Exectuive summary also has numbers and must be *bad ass*. No more than two sentences. See examples.
10. I changed all the names in the resumes to protect the innocent :)

**Notes on how to find jobs/ grow network:**

Please, please, *pleeeeeease* don't waste your time applying to LinkedIn or Indeed posted jobs. 99% chance it's a waste of time. I sent out 500+ resumes like that over the course of a year and got one interview from it.

Total fail.

Now that I work for a large company, I see just how true that is. We did a hiring spree at the beginning of this quarter and every single one of the new hires was a referral.

Every. Single. One.

Companies just post those because they ... have to? Not really sure, but again, this is my experience.

I can't stress enough how important it is to get an *in* at a company.

So how do you do that if your network is small, just starting out, or you dont have any friends (like me! lol)?

Get your LinkedIn up and going - this is super important because its the first thing hiring managers look at.

If you have exhausted all your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want, try this LinkedIn approach (the modules in the link also have other methods outside this one as well):

What I did was paste my resume info in the description field on LI, added a nice photo and background, and added a ton of people from realtor groups (they always accept requests) to get me to the coveted 500+ connection badge and make me look suuuuuuuper cool. (LI has a limit to the number of adds a day, so will take a few days to accomplish this).

I then sent DMs to people in a role or company that I wanted to work for. It went something like:

Look, I have a history of mental health issues and the the job search used to make me super depressed back in the day. I totally get it.

I don't want that for *anyone*.

You all should be spending time studying and not re-doing your resume for zillionth time.

That's why I took the time to make this guide.

I want the process to be as easy as possible for *everyone* and for *free*.

I'm sure your university has a Career Services department, but I can almost guarantee their resume and tips ain't as good this.

Anyways, best of luck to you all in getting that scholarship, internship or first job that sets you ever so slightly faster on the path for career success!

Let me know in the comments if this helped.

xa7iaz,The Futurist Society," 

Hello everyone!

I've created a national student club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We discuss flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We are building a Wiki of many types of future tech as a resource for people looking to know more about technology. We also have plans to start doing projects as our organization gets more established. We also have guest talks from speakers who work in tech!

Some of the things we are doing in TFS:

\- We have discussions on interesting future technologies and topics  
\- We have guest speakers who work in exciting fields  
\- We are building a Wiki of future technologies to help people learn more easily  
\- We booth at conferences to increase our network  
\- We are planning our own conference in the near future  
\- We are planning projects and other opportunities for our chapters

Right now there is no official chapter being formed at this school, but we are always looking for people to help us start one! Being one of our leaders could be a great opportunity in shaping your resume and in making connections! We also welcome anyone who just wants to join for our discussions.

We are a national network of students interested in shaping the future! If you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!

xrd0w4,I made ratemyprofessors but for classes: Rate My Courses,"
Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/okstate) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking. Also, since some courses depend on the professor, you can filter the reviews by professors and it will show you the average ratings for each professor.
Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.  (to leave a review, just search your course and you can submit a review at the bottom of the page)


Also, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this. And if anyone is interested in writing an article about this dm me!

Enjoy!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/xrd0w4/i_made_ratemyprofessors_but_for_classes_rate_my/,oopsidaisiess,1,2022-09-29 13:00:02,0,/r/OKState/comments/xrd0w4/i_made_ratemyprofessors_but_for_classes_rate_my/
