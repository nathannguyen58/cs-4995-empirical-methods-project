bnqlwi,Housing for married graduate students?,Hey I’m coming in the fall with a wife and a brand new baby.

Thanks everybody.,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/bnqlwi/housing_for_married_graduate_students/,This-Charisma,10,2019-05-12 12:08:41,32,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/bnqlwi/housing_for_married_graduate_students/
boyrzv,Would IU allow a sublease on one of their properties?,"Hello all! This fall I hope to be moving down to Bloomington and there’s a group of students living in one of the University’s homes that I would like to move in with. Everything had been going well and we were finalizing the arrangement but then they showed me the lease. Section 4a reads &gt;”No persons other than Tenant shall occupy the Premises without the prior written consent of the University. Tenant shall not subject the Premises or assign this lease without the University’s prior written approval. Occupancy by any person not named in the Lease Agreement for more than seven (7) consecutive nights shall constitute a breach under this lease unless prior written consent is obtained from the University.”

They claimed that there have never been any surprise visits to-date and that they’ve quietly subleased the property for almost two years at this point and the University apparently hasn’t noticed. Nevertheless, as someone who’s taken a basic Intro to Law course in the past, I am worried about the fallout if the University somehow catches wind of what we’d would be doing. My question is: **How likely would they be to approve this sublease if we were to ask them?** Has anyone had any experience with this before or with the IU Real Estate Department?

If we ask and they say no, obviously they’ll then check in at some point to make sure that we didn’t go ahead and do it anyway. Yet, if we keep it quiet and just have me move in secretly, there’s a danger of the whole thing coming undone if we get caught. I wouldn’t want to ruin a good thing for these people but I’m not sure that I’m comfortable with being a part of the sublease if it would be in violation of the contract either. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/boyrzv/would_iu_allow_a_sublease_on_one_of_their/,Richard_XXVII,8,2019-05-15 10:43:10,2,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/boyrzv/would_iu_allow_a_sublease_on_one_of_their/
bpfjp8,How soon are diplomas typically mailed?,In a bit of a dilemma. My parents are selling their house and there's no telling when it may sell so I don't wanna have my degree mailed there. The lease on my apartment in Bloomington ends on May 31st so I can't mail it there either. I'm moving to Georgia in a few weeks but I don't have an address there yet. The time frames are just weird and not knowing when degrees will be sent is making it harder to decide which address is should be mailed to. The commencement website says 10-12 weeks but when I called the recorder she said they could be mailed sooner. I'm not even sure who to contact in regards to this issue.

bw6yr4,Chances for Kelley petition,"So I’m currently a junior oos from SoCal and was wondering how lenient the Kelley petition acceptance rate is. I currently have a 4.0 W and a 1370 SAT superscore, ECs related to 2 years worth of collegiate research experience and some academic/athlete awards. I know the current direct admit for fall applications was a 3.8 and 1380, and am aware many students have gotten in with lower stats/compensation for either sat or gpa. I also saw on their website that the requirements can be subject to change when it is announced when apps open. I have two questions: 1. How likely do you think my petition will be accepted w my stats? 2. How likely do you think the direct admit requirements will be raised for fall 2020, based on past changes and increasingly fiercer competition?

c0e8kk,LF Kelley DA Schedule Advice - First Year,"&amp;#x200B;

![img](c52ywjpm68431)

For context, I'm deeply interested in Investment Banking. The current plan at the least is to major in Finance through Kelley. My current set-up is only at 13 credits to my understanding, however I'm looking to probably add one more class to this first Fall semester. I'm also interested in minoring or even double majoring in Computer Science to go along with the main Finance major plan. So, perhaps I add an intro CS course? I'm planning on taking another A&amp;H required course along with the other two required first year business courses (K-204 and Compass) during my second semester. Let me know! Brutal honesty hahah

\*Advice on one more class to add here is greatly appreciated

c2qua9,"Mac Computer for Gaming, School, and App Development - $3,500 Max","* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
$3,500 is my ABSOLUTE max. If there is a legitimate reason that I may need to go above that budget, I may consider but buying something that expensive does make me a little uneasy since this will be my first MAJOR purchase as an adult. I do get a discount from Indiana University with Apple so using [their configuration forms](https://www.apple.com/us_edu_168720/shop) may help with suggestions. Buying from the US.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
My only request is that it is a Mac laptop. I have a lot of software that I personally use for productivity that I couldn’t live without that is Apple exclusive, so I need that.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
Not important at all. I will be riding a bike around campus, though.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
Mac

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
N/A

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
*Gaming*:
* Factorio
* Truck Simulator
* CS:GO
* Prison Architect
* Rust
* Besiege

Light video editing

I am going to be a CS major and I intend to do some app development so I will need most of my power for that.

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
I’ve listed the games above. To be honest, 30 FPS and 60 FPS have a very slight difference that I can notice when they are put side by side so I’m fine with 30 FPS if that is the best we can do. Basically, as long as the game doesn’t look horrendous and I can play it smoothly, I’m fine.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
N/A

cc0rmk,Kelley MSIS Acceptance Timeline,"I recently applied and interviewed for the MSIS program - Fall 2020. I am wondering if anyone knows when the team typically notifies applicants of acceptance or denial. 

Separately, to begin the MSIS curriculum I was told by the program chair it’s advised to take 5 classes as prerequisites. I cannot remember the names of them, but I believe they are S-XXX classes. Are these mandatory? I am a double major in Accounting and Operations Management, and would have to take these prerequisites summer before Fall 2020 which would eliminate me from earning the internship credit before the program officially begins.

Honestly I would love any guidance that current or alum MSIS students have to offer,

cic3q3,Is it possible to appeal a grade in a class?,"I'm taking an online class which involves scanning and uploading images for assignments, quizzes and tests. Prior to the incident I'm going to talk about, I had absolutely no issues uploading files for assignments and quizzes. 

For my test, however, my professor told me that the file I submitted was corrupted and upgradable. I got a 50% on my midterm exam (got the multiple choice online questions correct)

I approached my professor about this, and he said he couldn't do anything because I was careless. But here's the fucking kicker: Canvas will not let you preview images for tests and quizzes (you can preview submissions of assignments up until the date they're due) Once they're submitted, they're submitted. So considering the fact that the file preview on my laptop was not corrupt and viewable, I guess it's my fault for submitting a ""corrupted file.""

1018 Donald Trump: You're gonna need $4 billion for me to take a blind eye.

1019 Porter: People are laughing because they think four billion is too much. I think it's not a problem when you have $35 billion.

Jack Dorsey provides a statement defining who their group is: ""The Illuminati is an underground organization of child rapists and homosexuals."" Matthew Porter: ""We have to thin the herd, so Barack is going to explain a few things."" At 232 Barack Obama says the following: ""You people have to realize we are child rapists. The Illuminati are child rapists. As soon as you figure that out, you can decide what to do. Everybody is freaking out about what just happened \[child raping event still going on\].

\\Please post this anywhere you can! Each google drive link is a backup to the wasabi link just in case one is ""down"". Getting blocked, censored, ""downvoted"" etc. These people are extremely wealthy and throw money to anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes &amp; murders, corruption. Ironically, this is usually done through a receivership transfer, where you receive the funds after four or more day, and it can be pulled at the last second, whch is usually the case, after you've done them the ""service"". 



A word about the ""f@\\&amp;&amp;ot"" usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have be stopped. Everyone out there needed to see this. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the headspace, which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of BS because they would not call each other f@%%ot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended.

cz13v3,NOMAD RIDES - $5.50 RIDES ANYWHERE ON CAMPUS,"Nomad used to be my secret ridesharing app that I used to flex on my homies to get us to wherever we needed to be on campus for just $5.50. But now that Nomad is receiving mad press coverage from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2019/08/22/nomad-rides-commission-free-ride-hailing/#3ef3be626be3) &amp; [FOX59](https://fox59.com/2019/08/27/iu-students-to-expand-their-college-ride-sharing-app-nomad-rides/).. I think it’s time I do everyone here justice by letting y’all know how amazing this service is. 

Next time you need to Uber or Lyft anywhere, **TRY A NOMAD**.  

1. **WHY PAY MORE THAN YOU NEED TO?** Nomad operates on a flat fee of $5.50 anywhere on campus. No surges. *It’s ALWAYS cheaper than Uber and Lyft.*  

2. **SUPPORT A MOVEMENT.** Nomad pays 100% of its fares to the drivers. In contrast, did you know Uber &amp; Lyft take 25-50% of the fares as commissions? This means that drivers only get to make 50-75% of what they should be making. 

3. **SAFEST PLATFORM.** A lot of my female friends have told me that they feel so much safer taking a Nomad. The majority of Nomad drivers are IU students and there are just so many stories about how they’ve been lifesavers.  

4. **FOUNDED AND OPERATED BY IU STUDENTS.** People. This is a service that was created for and by HOOSIERS. Dope. 

Just try it. You’ll thank me later. download the app on [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nomad-rides/id1390278983)

The stacks in the east tower work typically, but still if one person is eating, typing out a paper, or walking around with keys, I cannot stay focused.

dav3jo,"HIV Outbreak, Addiction, and A Painter","[Addict Turned Artist](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2017/11/27/austin-indiana-hiv-artist-addiction/576008001/)

Preface: I’ve posted the following on the Bloomington subreddit. But I’m trying here to research IU students specifically.

Why?

I’m having an Art Show and I want young guns there too. Because I wish to not just sell paintings, but inspire as well. 

Especially younger adults.

........................

Hello,

My name is Brian Charles Johnson, I’m 36 and have lived in Austin, Indiana my entire life. Austin lies in the poorest township in Indiana. You should see it here. Just heartbreak, the underprivileged, and desolation.

Due to intravenous drug use in my town, Austin became the epicenter of the largest rural outbreak of HIV in United States history in 2015. It became international news, the BBC came to town.

Out of a population of 4,000, 255 cases of HIV were reported as positive. 100% of the cases were contracted due to intravenous drug use.

I was an addict at the time, but decided to change my life. I went to my garage, bought the supplies, two books on how to paint, and am now close to a master of depicting light.

Some of the most prominent painters in the country have hinted at me be very much a possible figure in the art of painting’s history.

Time will only tell.

Initially on this subreddit I said my show would be this past summer, but I decided to go all out and pushed it to November.

My show will be opening November 1st at Untitled Light Gallery at The Dimension Mill on Madison Street in Bloomington.

Close to Upland Brewery.

I want everyone reading this to come. You will not be disappointed. I’m not looking for your money, I just wish to share my work with others.

So young and old alike, come check it out.

Please spread the word. And comment telling me if you are interested in going or not if you feel so compelled.

Thank You For Reading,

I heard someone say that applying auto admit, even with the stats of 30+ and 3.8+, you don’t have a solid chance of being admitted. Also, do they favor in state? (Originally from Chicago but now I’m out in San Francisco and, just for stats reasons, have a 30+ ACT and 3.8 GPA bc some people may ask if I am planning on petitioning) I would really appreciate some clarity on auto admit, as I really would love to go to Kelley, but I don’t want to have the wrong idea on something like this.

dkgi0l,Does anyone else follow TheTabIU's ig account? What's up with their promotion of a MLM?,"For those who don't know about it, TheTabIU is a ""News/Media Company"" that is run by IU students and has 14k+ followers on Instagram, although I don't believe they're officially affiliated with the university (though I could be wrong.) They're kinda like Barstool and post a lot of memes but their instagram story usually covers important news events happening around IU or Bloomington.

However, yesterday for the 2nd time, they posted an advertisement for a meeting for an organization called ""IU ATM"", an abbreviation for the considerably humble title of ""Activities That Matter."" Something that's important to note is that this organization, though it clearly claims to be an IU organization, does not show up anywhere on BeInvolved. The first time TheTabIU posted an for the club's callout meeting, roughly a month ago, it appeared really out of character and the ad looked really MLM-y so I did some digging and discovered that the club is a front for a business called iMarketsLive. The business is putting up these clubs at universities all around the country as part of an obnoxious growth strategy to prey on poor college students with the promise of making easy money ""from your cell phone."" I could talk more about this business but I feel like the mods would have a problem with it but basically their whole schtick is getting people into forex trading, which is an incredibly risky form of investing (and recruiting others to join the business of course)

Anyway, my question is, is anyone else weirded out by TheTabIU promoting this? When I asked them about it the first time, they just responded ""Clubs get free promotion, just policy.""

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/dlxk6s/why_study_maths_at_indiana_university_when_it_is/,qiling,0,2019-10-23 06:55:15,6,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/dlxk6s/why_study_maths_at_indiana_university_when_it_is/

doedt0,Kelley MBA - Student life with a young family,"Hey all,

I'll start off with this - I accepted my admission into Kelley's online MBA (spring term) and also have an interview coming up with their FT program (2020 intake).

For the past few months I became convinced that going the online route is best for me and my family. I already make decent salary (&gt;$100k) and not sure if it's worth the opportunity cost. Lately however, I have become intrigued about Kelley's FT program for my career goals. I'm definitely in the boat of wanting to be a career switcher and I know online would present more of an obstacle for me, or at least I'll need to work harder to achieve this.

My question/concern is: what should I expect out of Bloomington for my wife and young daughter (she'll be 18 months at matriculation). Being from Canada, my wife will not be working and I don't want her to feel neglected or alone caring for a child while I'm going through the rigors of the program. Since Bloomington is considered a ""college town"", does this present difficulties for my family? What attracts me to Kelley is the Kid's Club and Partner's Club but I don't have much insight other than their website. 

Any feedback helps.

Thanks everyone",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/doedt0/kelley_mba_student_life_with_a_young_family/,iammatt88,1,2019-10-28 16:02:45,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/doedt0/kelley_mba_student_life_with_a_young_family/

Person I spoke with said they are to only take IU calls if there are no Ivy Tech calls waiting to be answered. I'm sure some of my massive technology fee I pay every semester goes to paying for support, didn't realize it was second rate support.

A friend of mine had a big horn sheep skull that he had sitting on his front porch stolen sometime today. The lower jaw of the skull was left behind. They just took the top. He had collected this when he was out in Montana over the summer and it took him hours to hike and get the thing. If you saw anything or know someone who just happened to find a big horn sheep skull laying around give me a PM or have the person kindly return it no questions asked. 

It's an adult male big horn sheep skull and probably weighs a good 5 pounds and is pretty much impossible to hide in a bag due to size.

I'm a senior planning to graduate this May. For your reference, I have a complicated AAR because I have two majors, one minor and I'm doing a certificate so my required graduation credits are over 120. I think I have 16 credits left for satisfying my graduation requirement until I talked to my advisor last October. She edited my AAR and said she’s sure that I have only 10 left. In that case, I dropped 2 course (they are both full now)  on my spring schedule because I trusted my advisor, I applied to be a part time student, and found a spring semester internship in Indy. 
This afternoon, she sent my an email, telling me I cannot graduate with two more major selections, asking my plan, and changed my AAR. Wow, how surprise! This means I need to figure out my schedule today or I will have to pay the late drop/add fee, and nearly no available course can fit my schedule now!! Also I need to pay the full time student tuition, thousands more dollars:/ Also, I might need to tell my employer that I cannot take the offer since my academic schedule changed (I assume I cannot handle that internship as a full time student) .

In high school I had a solid group of friends and had parties to go to on weekends, and I thought college would be the same.

My question is what do I do now- I’m basically out of ideas besides trying to join more clubs (not sure which) or waiting until next fall to rush again and hoping that works out.

fi2moi,Why does the financial aid office seem to just hate poor people?,"Every single time I interact with the IUB OSFA, every interaction is an uphill battle.

After entering a SAP appeal, they told me I need to submit a letter saying that my chronic, incurable illness is cured or has improved, to receive financial aid. When I asked them why having a disability would mean I can't go to college, they simply replied ""You would not be expelled from Indiana University, you would simply need to pay yourself or apply for private loans."" Bare in mind, my grades were fine, my GPA had risen significantly, I just had gone over the first cusp of too many credit hours (125%). Withholding financial aid from someone on the basis that they have a disability, whether or not it inhibits academic process, so long as it is documented, is absolutely unethical. 

&amp;#x200B;

My laptop I appealed the cost of attendance for years ago broke. We are starting online classes. I, if it isn't obvious, have a pre-existing condition. I will be missing quite a lot of work, and self-quarantining, for my safety. Classes are held over webcam. I don't have a fully functioning laptop. Quite frankly, I don't think it can be repaired at all. It is visibly totaled. First, the screen broke and some issues arose with the motherboard. With it being kept in storage while I saved money to get it repaired, it literally fell off of a shelf 10 feet up, and broke along the hinges. When I contacted them for an appeal, they told me there was nothing they could do without a repair bill or quote. I don't get the choice to choose between fixing my laptop, and food and rent. It is quite obviously food and rent that wins out. I can literally send them a picture of a laptop, split in half, broken screen, won't turn on. But no, I need to spend $50-$150 for a professional quote telling them that it likely can't even be repaired. Before they will let me replace it. Now, I have some ideas of what to do, and I'm sure I'll be fine, but the absolute negligence and blind bureaucracy of the financial aid office astounds me. Rather than helping students, they want to reinforce the cycle of poverty. If it doesn't cost hundreds more than it should, you're doing it wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

So why do we allow ourselves to have a financial aid office that genuinely just hates poor students? 

Has anyone else had similar, abysmal experiences?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/fi2moi/why_does_the_financial_aid_office_seem_to_just/,Anonymousanon4079,1,2020-03-13 12:46:27,21,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/fi2moi/why_does_the_financial_aid_office_seem_to_just/

Right now most of my college decisions are out, and I’m mainly deciding between IU’s Kelley and UNC Chapel Hill (OOS for both). I’ve been leaning towards Kelley because it’ll be cheaper for me and I’ll have less debt since I managed to receive 11k a year for the Dean’s scholarship. This brings IU to ~37k a year vs. UNC ~53k a year. 

Will there be any substantial difference between attending a cheaper business school like IU instead of a more expensive but prestigious school like UNC? The difference in average salary out of business school is barely any different (64k vs. 68k). Also, is there an opportunity for me to receive additional scholarships?

fue7xh,Professional Graduation Photos at IU - Spring 2020,"Hey Hoosiers! My name is Trevor.

Each year at Purdue in West Lafayette, I take photos for graduates walking around campus with the various campus icons / statues / photogenic buildings / flowers / etc.

[Here's a gallery of some examples of my favorites to date](https://photos.tmahlmann.com/People/Graduation/) if you'd like to see some of what I am talking about.

Until now, I have just done these photos at Purdue. I've wanted to do these at Indiana on the Bloomington campus as well for awhile and with everything going on lately, now seems like the perfect time to do it. With commencement postponed, I think these will prove even more important / meaningful for the graduates that I am able to take them for.

I'll be doing 1 hr 45 min photo sessions each day / all day: May 3rd thru 10th.

I can do individual, small/large group, or small/large family sessions.

If you want some awesome shots to remember your graduation by:

[Here's a link to where you can reserve your timeslot online](https://www.tmahlmann.com/2020/03/spring-2020-indiana-graduation-photography/). (I normally do a $50 price bump right around this time/30 days before sessions begin, but I'm not going to be doing that this year with everything going on)

[Here's a link to an FAQ I created](https://www.tmahlmann.com/2020/03/spring-2020-indiana-graduation-photography/#FAQ). Head over there first if you have questions and if you still do after reading, feel free to leave them below/PM or email me [trevor.mahlmann@gmail.com](mailto:trevor.mahlmann@gmail.com) \- I'd be happy to help.

\-----

Yes, I haven't done these types of photos at IU to-date but:

\- I hope my example gallery at Purdue speaks for itself that I am capable.

\- I have curated a list of places / vistas on campus that will make for nice photos and will of course accommodate ideas that you might have!

\- My sessions at Purdue are usually 1hr 15min and these are 1 hr 45 min, allowing a bit more flexibility with it being my first year doing them.

Barring any physical restrictions preventing me from getting to Bloomington to make these photos (travel / etc) since this is my work - I am gonna help as many people that are interested. I feel I'll be able to keep my distance properly as a portrait photographer while still giving you awesome photos to remember your time in Bloomington by!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/fue7xh/professional_graduation_photos_at_iu_spring_2020/,TMahlman,1,2020-04-03 14:59:29,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/fue7xh/professional_graduation_photos_at_iu_spring_2020/

gcx9ko,Professional Graduation Photos at IU - Spring 2020,"Hey Hoosiers! My name is Trevor.

Each year at Purdue in West Lafayette, I take photos for graduates walking around campus with the various campus icons / statues / photogenic buildings / flowers / etc.

[Here's a gallery of some examples of my favorites to date](https://photos.tmahlmann.com/People/Graduation/) if you'd like to see some of what I am talking about.

Until now, I have just done these photos at Purdue. I've wanted to do these at Indiana on the Bloomington campus as well for awhile and with everything going on lately, now seems like the perfect time to do it. With commencement postponed, I think these will prove even more important / meaningful for the graduates that I am able to take them for.

I'll be doing 1 hr 45 min photo sessions each day / all day: May 4th thru 10th.

I can do individual, small/large group, or small/large family sessions. As long as you've been quarantining with these people or these people have also been quarantining properly -- happy to do it! 

If you want some awesome shots to remember your graduation by:

Head over there first if you have questions and if you still do after reading, feel free to leave them below/PM or email me [trevor.mahlmann@gmail.com](mailto:trevor.mahlmann@gmail.com) \- I'd be happy to help.

\-----

Yes, I haven't done these types of photos at IU to-date but:

\- I hope my example gallery at Purdue speaks for itself that I am capable.

\- I have curated a list of places / vistas on campus that will make for nice photos and will of course accommodate ideas that you might have!

\- My sessions at Purdue are usually 1hr 15min and these are 1 hr 45 min, allowing a bit more flexibility with it being my first year doing them.

Barring any physical restrictions preventing me from getting to Bloomington to make these photos (travel / etc) since this is my work - I am gonna help as many people that are interested. I feel I'll be able to keep my distance properly as a portrait photographer while still giving you awesome photos to remember your time in Bloomington by!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/gcx9ko/professional_graduation_photos_at_iu_spring_2020/,TMahlman,1,2020-05-03 16:09:19,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/gcx9ko/professional_graduation_photos_at_iu_spring_2020/

Also they will charge people who want to stay after Thanksgiving break which seems really dirty considering we are probably paying more next year for housing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/hu3pnh/will_iu_give_a_prorated_refund_for_housing_if/,WannabeProgrammer_,41,2020-07-19 12:55:48,73,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/hu3pnh/will_iu_give_a_prorated_refund_for_housing_if/

hv9iee,Online Body Acceptance Class - Female Participants Wanted (Age 16-26)," *Do you struggle with body-image and self-esteem? Would you benefit from a* FREE intervention program, that has helped hundreds of other women?  

***Participate in the Stanford's Virtual Body Project!***

*Please fill out* ***this form:*** [***https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_bQ9ApVpWQn7bTEx***](https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bQ9ApVpWQn7bTEx) *if you'd like to participate in our research study and we'll get you assigned to a group. Contact Ayotola (*[*zonipede@stanford.edu*](mailto:zonipede@stanford.edu)*) with questions!*

The Stanford Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science is launching a research study for the **Virtual Body Project**, an online, peer-led body acceptance program. The program consists of four, 1-hour sessions over 4 weeks via Zoom Videoconferencing.    

*What will I get by participating in the Body Project?*

Over 20 years of research shows that participants experience improved body confidence and eating behaviors, as well as a reduction in negative mood. Participating in this group will also provide you with the opportunity to develop a support system or community with the women in your group.

*Who is eligible?*  
All women ages 16-26. Tell your friends! 

*What will I be doing during the sessions?*

Groups complete verbal, written, and behavioral exercises together during the sessions. Participants learn about body activism, how to manage societal pressures to look a certain way, and discuss the costs of pursuing a beauty ideal. 

*Who is in the group with me?*

Each group consists of 6 women and 2 Peer Leaders. We randomly assign groups based on availability. 

*How much does it cost?*

**No cost!** The Body Project is donation-based; it's free of charge and those who want to can donate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/hv9iee/online_body_acceptance_class_female_participants/,Stanford_ED_Research,0,2020-07-21 11:37:18,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/hv9iee/online_body_acceptance_class_female_participants/

ict2z1,Suspended for a year because of soccer-related incident,"I achieved a status of deferred suspension for helping a friend cheat off of my homework in Computer Science in the spring of 2019. I took accountability for this and was warned further lapses of misconduct could lead to a suspension for one academic year. Fast forward to now, two days ago to be precise, I just had my access to IU technology accounts revoked. Furthermore, I can’t even check IU student center.

On May 1 2020, I received the dreaded email of my suspension, which put me into me mental shock. I still vividly remember the day. In the email it stated that my suspension would be enacted on May 18 2020 and would last for a year and on May 18, I would lose access to my IU email and not be able to register for coursework. However, after that date, I was still able to register for classes, send emails and the usual. Moreover, I even took three summer courses and did well in all of them (A’s). The beginning of August went well for me and I was tenaciously checking Canvas to see if syllabi were uploaded in order to start pre-reading and getting myself acclimated with the material. However, on August 17th, when opening up my email, I had seen that my access to IU email was blocked and all other IU technology accounts were subsequently blocked. 

Obviously, this is extremely problematic due to the short time notice. I thought that due to the nature of the second incident (being written up for juggling my soccer ball multiple times  outside the entrance of Tulip Tree Apartments) would allay concerns of Office of Student Conduct; I should also state that I did not hit anyone else or damage any property. Though juggling my soccer ball was not the most sound thing to do in hindsight, I can unequivocally state that magnitude of this infraction is on the lower end of the spectrum. Furthermore, other big ten schools, due to the status quo/COVID would be withholding enacting suspensions during this time period. I have already signed a lease and it looks like the prospect of losing thousands of dollars is becoming more and more probably dat by day. Secondly, I am 2 courses away from graduating with a degree in physics and had my future plans contingent on this semester. To be succinct, I feel this is a total stab in the heart. I am meeting with the Associate Dean on Friday, and am prepared to go up the chain of command to achieve a favorable outcome. Anyone have any guidance for me? I have already reached out to the Student Advocacy Office and, the person I talked to said the decision was irrational.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ict2z1/suspended_for_a_year_because_of_soccerrelated/,Kinetic_Isotope,1,2020-08-19 14:15:59,7,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ict2z1/suspended_for_a_year_because_of_soccerrelated/

ihyck9,Per email from the university: increase in cases at Greek houses is resulting in immediate quarantine of everyone at several houses and complete suspension of all in person activities at all houses,"Copied and pasted from the email:

&gt;Increase in cases at Greek houses

&gt;An alarming increase of positive COVID-19 tests within Greek, Evans Scholars and Christian Student Fellowship houses at IU Bloomington has been identified through IU&amp;rsquo;s mitigation testing efforts. Because these are cases of community transmission, all houses have been directed to suspend all in-person organizational activities (other than dining and housing for live-in members) until at least Sept. 14, 2020. No IU residence halls are included in these measures. 

&gt;Eight Greek houses will be required to quarantine and are receiving notices from the Monroe County Health Department, along with a directive reinforcing this notice from the IUB Division of Student Affairs. There is a strong possibility other houses will be impacted this same way. A list of houses directed to quarantine can be found here.  https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/get-involved/sororities-fraternities/osfl-covid-19/index.html

&gt;Dedicated effort to combat COVID-19

&gt;IU leadership has been working with fraternity and sorority chapters since the onset of COVID-19 given the special risk factors associated with this specific type of communal living. As residences not owned or operated by the university, housed Greek and student organizations were instructed to develop their own specific isolation and quarantine plans following guidance and recommendations from IU and the Monroe County Health Department. IU will continue to work with the Monroe County Health Department to support chapters during this time.

&gt;Positive COVID-19 cases were anticipated by IU administration. Plans and procedures have been put in place to mitigate COVID-19 on all IU campuses. IU continues to closely monitor the number of cases, conduct mitigation testing and contact tracing, alongside other prevention efforts.



&gt;While IU may continue to see additional cases identified in congregate housing locations, the risk of transmission will be greatly reduced by students and others in the IU community avoiding parties and gatherings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ihyck9/per_email_from_the_university_increase_in_cases/,PostNaGiggles,1,2020-08-27 21:54:46,56,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ihyck9/per_email_from_the_university_increase_in_cases/

ikp2iu,Volunteers to lead English as a Second Language virtual classes,"Hey everyone, we're in the process of bringing the International &amp; American Student Alliance (IASA) to IU and one of its biggest programs is English Clusters. This program provides free, non-credit English as a Second Language (ESL) classes to international students who want to practice and improve their English skills in a casual environment. These classes are typically led by students who are native (or at least near fluent) English speakers and interested in helping international students and/or gaining teaching experience.

Class topics can range anywhere from skill-based (i.e. pronunciation, writing for graduate students, reading) to topic-based (i.e. Southern culture, American movies) to casual conversation-based (i.e. discussion of current events, practicing English by playing games). While the teaching opportunities in this program are great for those studying to become English/ESL teachers or wanting to teach abroad, we still encourage you to reach out if it sounds interesting to you.

For this semester, all of these classes will be completely virtual and will begin the week of Monday, September 14th. Classes typically meet once a week for around 50 minutes and there's a lot of flexibility for the day/time that they can be taught. In addition to these classes being open to all IU international students, we're combining the English Clusters across all of the universities that our organization is at (Ole Miss, Auburn, University of Georgia, etc.) this Fall since everyone is virtual anyway. This means that an international student from IU can participate in a class led by someone at Ole Miss, and vice-versa.

If this program sounds interesting to you and you'd potentially be interested in leading one of these classes, please dm me and I can give you more information!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ikp2iu/volunteers_to_lead_english_as_a_second_language/,at11b5,1,2020-09-01 13:48:01,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ikp2iu/volunteers_to_lead_english_as_a_second_language/

ipnud3,Remote Learning Coaching for Students,"Hello, my name is Hayden and I am a sophomore at the University of Washington in Seattle. I struggle with what are called executive function skills, which are the skills you use to manage your day and make decisions. These skills include planning and prioritization, time management, organization, task initiation, and sustained attention. Over a period of three years, I was able to develop and implement a system to overcome these challenges, and I wrote about it in my book, *Freshman 101: The Guidebook to Planning, Prioritization, and Time Management*.

I noticed that a lot of students had similar challenges with these skills with the transition to remote learning in the spring. Seeing this need, I have[ created a set of remote learning coaching sessions](http://remotelearningcoaching.com/) to help students improve on these skills, which are critical for success. If any of the following describe your experience - or if you are concerned about them for fall term - then this program is right for you.

* Struggled to stay organized and keep your assignments straight
* Consistently ran up against deadlines
* Struggled to manage your workload and balance lectures with work
* Were unable to break assignments or projects into smaller, more manageable and actionable pieces

Over three, one hour sessions, you will learn strategies to address all of these, how to think about remote learning, and, for freshmen, how to read a syllabus.

You can learn more about my website[remotelearningcoaching.com](https://remotelearningcoaching.com) or email me at remotelearningcoaching@gmail.com.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ipnud3/remote_learning_coaching_for_students/,Checkmate_363,1,2020-09-09 15:59:27,4,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ipnud3/remote_learning_coaching_for_students/

I'm building a community-based app that gives college students a safe, anonymous place to share personal things in a supportive and open environment with others at your school. It will be social and will be focused on sharing the difficult things in life with other students.

I really hope to make a positive impact and help as many people as struggling in silence. I'm currently developing it and would love any and all feedback. 

If you could take a couple seconds to fill out this 8 question survey, it really would mean the world to me. Thank you so much! :)

j4h517,Extremely Frustrated with Online Class &amp; Unprofessional Professor,"I am an undergraduate student in the school of Public Health, and one of my pre-requisites is to take Abnormal Psychology (PSY-P324). 

When I initially signed up for classes, all the available ones were listed as in-person, so I took the MFW course with a very well-respected professor in the school of Psychology. I did my due diligence (lol) and used ratemyprofessors and asked around, and EVERYONE told me that this particular professor was amazing and the ""best of the school."" About a week after I signed up for class, I was informed that the class was now only offered online.

 \*Cool!\* I thought. I never imagined it would be a big deal because this was MONTHS in advance of the fall semester (it was announced back in June). I figured my professor would have plenty of time to revise the course for an online format. I don't expect perfection in online classes, not even close. But the experience I've received in this class is an absolute joke. 

7 weeks in and I've never been so frustrated and confused over a college class in my entire life. I should have swapped in week 1 but I wanted to hold on because everyone swore up and down that the dude teaching this class was ""amazing.""

 I'll try to briefly list the shenanigans that this dude has put us through since week 1: 

1. Took almost 3 weeks to upload a syllabus, responded extremely rudely to anyone who asked about what our readings or assignments were supposed to be. He just uploads random videos with tons of misspellings and confusing labels in his announcements. They never have anything to do with our textbook readings. 
2. Originally told us all that lectures would be posted at 9:00 am MWF. He uploads ""lectures"" (they are really just videos of him rambling at his chair, they never line up with what our textbook reading is supposed to be) at random, unpredictable times and sometimes expects us to complete assignments out of nowhere within hours. He's uploaded ""lectures"" at Saturday 11:00 pm, Sunday 7:00 pm, Thursdays and Tuesdays randomly etc. etc. 
3. Our first exam was supposed to Friday, 10/2. He said literally nothing about the exam all week and pretended it didn't exist, until I finally emailed him on Thursday (10/1) asking if the exam was still happening and if so, when will it be/what will be on over?? He sent out a passive aggressive Canvas announcement in response. He said something along the lines of, ""If you didn't show up to class, I said that the exam would be pushed back to Tuesday and available at 8:00 am.""   
Like ??? first of all, this ""class"" that he's chastising us for missing was decided randomly with no warning for Wednesday at 4:00 pm, which is when I WORK. AND this class was supposed to be asynchronous... and also, I am busy all day Tuesday so god help us if he doesn't make it open all day.

I could honestly go on and on but at this point I am just shocked. It honestly feels like this guy doesn't give a single shit about this course or teaching us anything at all or even TRYING to have a class that makes sense. I am angry and feel absolutely cheated by spending my money on this bullshit. I still have no fucking clue what the first exam is going to look like because he has explained nothing and gets a holier than thou attitude every time you dare ask him about it. 

Thank you for letting me get that off his chest, please feel free to share your experiences with online courses this semester. Am I getting screwed or is this just the new reality of online classes?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/j4h517/extremely_frustrated_with_online_class/,EmergencyReflection1,1,2020-10-03 11:41:25,11,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/j4h517/extremely_frustrated_with_online_class/

I'm a high school senior applying for direct admit through petition for kelley. I have to go test-optional for the time being because all my testing centers were forced to close because of covid (I live in California). I have a 3.76 GPA (weighted) and good ecs (own and run a education technology startup, see [nize.education](https://nize.education) for more), there's more but I don't want to bore you. We're implementing our solutions with several high schools here in California, don't mean to flex, just for context. I do have a couple of Cs on my transcript, would that automatically disqualify me from admission through petition. I had to split my time with my startup and school, turns out running a startup and going to school full-time isn't ideal. 

Would the Cs and test-optional just completely destroy my chances?

Again, I apologize for asking this since it gets asked every other week.

jbh46d,Important question about the Kelley petition,"Hello,

As application deadlines are approaching, I'm facing a stressful dilemma regarding what to do. My situation is I have a 3.5 UW GPA, about a 3.78 W GPA in a competetive school, good ECs, recs, essays, 4 APs, but with COVID-19 I was only able to take 1 ACT and SAT a year ago getting a 29 and a 1340. These scores are pretty rough and hurt my chances.

I'm planning on applying ED to Villanova because it's the only school I feel I have a real chance of getting into for business with my scores and GPA. I'm going to petition to Kelley too, but given I don't have the required GPA and test score for standard DA, I'm not too optimistic.

I'd love to attend either Kelley or Villanova, but am not sure if I have much of a chance of getting into Kelley with my GPA and scores. Do I have much of a chance? I'd like to know if it's worth EDing or not to Villanova. I'd definetly prefer Kelley over Villanova for financial reasons, but if my chances are slim I'd rather cut my losses and ED to Villanova.

I figured in pretty good at handling stress. Spring semester and fall have kicked my butt. I wanna say it’s COVIDs fault but idk. Maybe it’s just that my classes are getting harder and expecting more. I’m looking at a 3.5 now and I’m disappointed. That’s close to the GPA I got in high school and I got Cs and Ds the first two years. I know that a mix of As and Bs is good enough for most jobs and if I have more Bs than As it’s probably not as big of a deal as I’m making it. My husband and a lot of my friends get straight As in their classes and they’re not easy ones either.

keawno,Paid mental health research opportunity for undergrads! ($50),"This study is run through Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and involves using a new mental health app to allow for passive and active data collection. The new app is intended to be a helpful mental health resource. In the future it will be used for patients in therapy, but right now we are opening it up to college undergrads for research purposes. 

**The study is 1 month long and involves a total compensation of $50. This is broken down into $15 after week 1, $15 after week 3, and $20 at the end of the study.**

The basic layout of the study is as follows:

\- you would complete the informed consent and enrollment process on the secure RedCap platform

\- you would attend a short (&lt; 30min) webinar where a researcher would explain how the app works

\- for 28 days you would complete a 11 question daily survey (should take less than 5 min each day)

\- every other week you would complete a longer bi-weekly survey (and get paid after these)

\- at the end of the study you would receive a final payment. 

**If you are interested, please follow the RedCap link below to enroll. This will lead you to the informed consent where you can find out more information about the study.**

I’m a current senior in high school and I got accepted into IUB a few weeks ago. I was pretty excited until my parents, who most definitely have the means to support me, told me that they wouldn’t be paying for my tuition. I was wondering if there was anyone that could help me figure out what I could do.

I’ve also been selling as much of my stuff as I can and am trying to find a job so I can stockpile some cash. I am planning on working throughout college, so if anyone could tell what on campus jobs there are that would be helpful. I’ll contact the office for financial aid soon and see what they have to say. I should say that I am an Ohio resident, so I would be paying out of state tuition. I did apply to a few in state unis, and I am keeping my eye on them, but so far no other schools have offered me anything. I’ve already gotten the Deans Scholarship for IU, so I have a bit of something. Also I’m interested in doing research for my major - which is psych - and it looks like there’s some opportunities through the ASURE program thing.

B4Grad has since grown and we got a major boost by the pandemic that the world has been facing.

We are looking for students to test the product as we launch several new features this upcoming semester including our note editor. You can send us the feedback via email or write a review on the App Store. That’s it.

And in exchange, we’ll give you the premium version of the app for free. It’s that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit.

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn’t good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has.

I saw that the BA is for if you want to major in a degree from the college of arts and science, and if I were to go down that path. Would I take the same classes as someone who chose the BS route? Would it impact me down the line for getting a job whether I had a BS or BA?

mjbcch,Advice for out of state freshman to meet new people this semester (or in the next few).,"Hi everyone! My little brother moved to Bloomington in January from Texas and I am obviously concerned about his ability to meet people outside of his roommates. I am a senior at Texas A&amp;M and am trying to help him make the most of this semester while COVID is slowing down. Does anyone have any advice for him on social organizations or groups to join?

A little about him, he is a sports management/marketing major and I know he is currently on the student athletic board but with it being totally virtual he is struggling to meet people. 

I don’t really see him as a frat kinda guy, but I think he would enjoy some form of all mens social orgs. Do y’all have those? Or what are some popular social orgs in general? 

Im just trying to help him find his place so far from home, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

mjcjf4,"We're a team of 4th yrs who built a new app for campus social life. BUT, before we launch at IU, we want to hear some real, honest feedback on how we can improve &amp; customize it for IU.","We're a group of students who have all dealt with the struggles of finding and connecting with like-minded people on campus. It's never been easy to make meaningful connections when you're on a campus with thousands of other kids. But we decided to take up the challenge and build a platform that could actually help change that.

Our solution is called Den, an organized approach to finding campus roommates, friends, dates, events, and more. The platform isn't near its final form, but here is what we've built so far: [***current version.***](https://den.university/IU)

Before we shift our focus to growth, we want to learn how we can improve and even customize Den for every campus. Any feedback, positive or negative, is so so helpful! Den is currently far from perfect, but listening to students like you is the best way we can improve and build something that people care about.

We're still cleaning up minor bugs in the app, but our focus right now is just hearing students' thoughts on what we've built so far. The platform is aimed more towards underclassmen, though we'd love to hear from upperclassmen as well about features we can add that would make life as a junior/senior better.

I've done a lot of work this far and plan to buy the domain very soon. At this point I believe the next step will require partners. 

**What I'm looking for:**

1. **Someone who can run social media pages**. This could be someone with a marketing background or someone who simply feels comfortable starting a social media page. After talking through my idea the next step is going to be popularizing the website through social media because it's a free form of marketing.
2. **Someone with a sleep science background**. One of the differentiating factors of the website will be the scientific backing of products and although one can do research to get a rough understanding, I think the company would be best suited with a partner specifically dedicated to this effort.

mu5ak9,IU Bloomington vs ASU vs SJSU | FOR BUSINESS,"Hi, I am a hs senior. I got into ASU's W.P Carey School of Business for the major I wanted. I also got into a local college which is San Jose State for business. As well as also getting into IU Bloomington for pre-business (not directly admitted into Kelley School of Business). I would then have to do the standard admit process, in order to get in. It's a risk though because if I don't get the required GPA, then I'll be in IU not being able to pursue a business degree.

Was wondering what would be better for my major since IU Kelley School of Business is top 20 business schools in US, but that SJSU is not really ranked. I really don't want to be that close to home as I am from the Bay Area, but IU seems like a whole new experience and also a risk (since I am not directly admitted into the business program). ASU however, I already got into the business program, its close but not too far from home, campus is amazing, top 30 business school; however tuition there is expensive and I didn't get much money from them. Neither did I get a lot of money from IU either.

I am deciding between these three and would like input from other people. I also don't know how this whole job application process works and what hiring managers look at and what they take into consideration. Any advice would be helpful.

n0m5kz,Cheap LSAT Tutoring - $30/hr,"Hello friends! I graduated IU in December, and while I wait to start law school in the fall, I am offering high quality low cost LSAT tutoring. Applying to law school is crazy expensive, and LSAT tutoring,  the cream of law school preparation, often runs in the hundreds of  dollars. Powerscore, for example, charges $175 for private tutoring.  Well, I am here to help!

&amp;#x200B;

**A little about me:**

I  got a 176 on my LSAT, which I took on the last in person administration before COVID. (I was sick and had cut off my finger tip a couple weeks earlier and actually underperformed my PTs.) I will be attending the  University of Michigan in fall on a full tuition + stipend scholarship; I  am living proof of how much money can be saved by quality LSAT prep! As  evidenced by my score, I am well versed in all LSAT subjects and even  helped one student eliminate her testing anxiety. I have been tutoring  in various subjects for almost ten years and have been tutoring for  several months in the LSAT (see comments eventually for testimonial from  my current students!).

**What you're paying for:**

One-on-one  tutoring including going through problems, teaching the underlying  concepts in logic, and fine-tuning your strategy. As an ""introductory  offer"", your first two sessions will be $30 apiece and $45 afterwards.  That's a 50% discount for your first two hours! And it's a 75% discount  on the major prep websites, wow, what a deal.

Please  let me know what questions you have. You can sign up to work with me at  the link below, and if the times available don't work for you, message  me, and we'll work something out. Thanks!

n56y5e,Incoming grad student looking for housing advice (especially on-campus housing),"I am starting my 3-year program at Maurer this fall, and I have been looking for apartments in Bloomington. My goals are simple: quiet, and within walking distance to Maurer. So far the apartments I've looked over seemed a little bit over-priced (i.e., 1300 per month for a studio). 

I just started looking into some of the on-campus apartments provided by IU. Wells and The Avenue all seem to be good choices. But I am also concerned that they are occupied by undergrads partying all nights. Is it usual for graduate students to live on-campus (most students in the Law School are renting in downtown)? Is there any quiet on-campus apartments that is occupied by more mature students?

I told people that I was interested in PoliSci, as well as public administration, policy, and international affairs/relations. This is why a few people in this sub told me about SPEA and Hamilton Lugar School.

How does IU-Bloomington compare to other Midwest PoliSci schools (UW-Madison, Michigan State, and OSU)? Originally, many said that a PoliSci degree from IUB wasn’t worth it. I’d probably only go to UI-Bloomington for O’Neill or Lugar School if I was accepted not for a regular PoliSci degree.

npxjx4,We talked to our lawyers. IU won't require documented proof of vaccine....,"

TL:DR:  IU won't require vaccine information to be collected /  uploaded  for the COVID19 experimental/emergency use vaccine, but does request everyone to attest that they have either had a vaccine or have a medical or religious exemption.        

#     

Indiana University has ~~(talked to our lawyers)~~  released new   health and safety guidance for the upcoming fall semester that will be         effective beginning Aug. 1. This guidance includes details on the         COVID-19 vaccine requirement for all students, faculty and staff, as         well as lifting most restrictions on masking and physical  distancing. 



## Requesting a vaccine exemption

 

IU has made adjustments to its vaccine         verification and exemption process after receiving ~~(threats of lawsuits)~~ feedback from students, parents, faculty and staff. A form for requesting vaccination         exemption for medical or religious reasons, or an online exemption for         those who will not be present on or near a campus, will be available         June 2.   
 



## Certifying vaccine status

Those who have received the COVID-19         vaccine will no longer be required to upload documentation ~~(since requiring so is against state law)~~ , but will         instead be able to certify their status as part of a simple attestation ~~(honor system)~~         form available  starting June 2. Details of an incentive program for         those who upload vaccine documentation will be announced soon. 

 

## Masks and physical distancing

 

Wearing a mask on campus will be         optional for those who are fully vaccinated. Those who are exempt from         the vaccine requirement or in the process of becoming fully vaccinated         should continue to wear a mask on campus.   
 

Classrooms, labs, housing, dining and other campus facilities will         return to pre-pandemic capacities with no physical distancing         required. 



## COVID-19 testing

 

Those who are fully vaccinated will         not be required to participate in mitigation testing, but they may be         asked to participate in surveillance testing to monitor for areas of         concern.   
 

Those exempt from the vaccine requirement or in the process of getting         vaccinated will continue to participate in mitigation testing.

So, my schedule for fall semester is 13 credits, but it’s really only 10 credits because I’m taking BUS-X 170 (summer class but counts toward fall semester). I’m taking BUS-C 106, A-100, PSY-P 101, and BUS-F 100. So I’m taking 4 classes for half of the semester and 3 classes for the second half (since A100 is only 8 weeks). 

Is this a super light course load? I’m kind of worried even though it’s still “full-time” since it’s 12+ credits. 

On one hand I think it’s okay since I’m bringing in like 15 AP/transfer credits and it’ll help me ease into freshman year and balance academics/rushing.

ogoqgf,"Waitlisted into Discrete Structures, Will I get off the waitlist?","Im position 2 on a waitlist. Actually, I can enroll into the class itself but I think the only available lab is at the same time as the class I chose(because that was the only available class). It is an evening class, and there's a good amount of evening labs open. 

The lab I'm on position for on the waitlist is from 8:45-10 in the morning. I purposefully chose this. Other times do work for me and I will be position 1 on the waitlist if I chose any other time, but I thought people r more likely to drop out of a morning class and there's a good amount of evening slots open so PERFECT for them, if they take the other version of discrete structures.

Gratefully, my symptoms are mild, and I will continue to work and lead the university during this time from my home office.  
 

While the vaccine is not 100% effective, I am so grateful to be protected from more serious symptoms.

1. You definitely want to bring a mini fridge and a microwave to your dorm. If you're living in a dorm, then cooking is practically out of the window. 
2. You should bring something to decorate your dorm room. Most of the residence halls look like prison cells and it's up to you to make it look lively and homey. 
3. Don't smoke or burn your microwave in your dorm room. Every room has a smoke detector and they are sensitive. I've seen someone getting kicked out because they got annoyed and destroyed the detector. Imagine how annoying it has to be. 
4. If you need a ride after going out late at night, IU provides safety rides for students: search for IU Ride.
5. Unless you absolutely need a car to commute for a good reason, you don't really have to bring your vehicle for your 1st year. Most of you won't be eligible for parking permits with better options and still end up taking buses throughout the week. 
6. I-bucks is not exactly money-saving, but campus dining halls and stores are everywhere and easy to find. For what it's worth, I think it is a good option if you prefer to stay on campus for the most part of the day like I do. 
7. Make sure to ace your first-year classes. They are mostly introductory and easy to get good grades if you put in some effort. But if you somehow screw up your grades in year 1, then you will find yourself struggling for the next 3 years to make up for the loss. 
8. A lot of things can happen in life, and your instructors will understand it. But first you need to tell your instructors of what's going on for that to happen. 
9. You want your professors to remember you (obviously in a good way). One professor that I've managed to impress asked me to write a letter to the chair of the department so that he could be promoted (this was part of the procedure in his tenure-track) and in exchange, he wrote me a letter to grad school. 
10. Make as many friends as you can. Networking is also a part of university experience, and you never know when that network will come in useful. Besides, IU is a partying school and you want to get as many invitations to hang out for fun. 
11. Start looking for next year's housing as early as possible. IU has approximately 50k students and it can get rather competitive to find a good place. If you're thinking about on-campus apartments (campus view, tulip tree, etc) for 2nd year and above, it is best to sign up no later than October. Off campus housing can wait until Spring, or even Summer. I would say Spring semester is the safest time to start looking for housing (around March - April)",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/oqf4n8/short_tips_for_incoming_freshmen/,kenny950905,1,2021-07-23 20:22:03,8,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/oqf4n8/short_tips_for_incoming_freshmen/

or0itx,Worth Transfering + Changing a Major?,"I'm a rising sophomore at Purdue studying CS. Purdue sucks, yeah, yeah, yeah... anyways, during the last year I've explored the idea of changing my plan of study. I'd like to go into business. I've been trading stocks on the side for the last couple of years and it's something I've really come to love. It's always on my mind, unlike CS. I feel like it's going to be harder down the road to really apply myself at programming if it's not something I love, even with the 6-figure paychecks, I will never really excel. Furthermore, my dad has been in IB for years and recently I've been talking to him a lot more about his connections + lifestyle working in PE. Needless to say, I'm intrigued, I really am, but I'm torn on what exactly I should do. Purdue's finance isn't the best but I don't know if it's logical to drop CS, add finance and just cross my fingers I DA to Kelley for the 2022 school year. It just feels like I could waste a lot of time (and money) hoping to get in somewhere with no guarantee. Furthermore, even with above a 3.5 (currently) I could get straight up rejected and now I'm stuck with Purdue Business. This isn't so much a chance me type of post, but rather a ""what the hell would you do in my situation"" type of post. I'm spending a ton of money and time doing something I kind of don't like, currently on track to do another 2 semesters of classes that wouldn't even give me credit for business, and missed all the transfer deadlines by 1-2 months.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/or0itx/worth_transfering_changing_a_major/,SMOO765,1,2021-07-24 19:25:57,2,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/or0itx/worth_transfering_changing_a_major/

ows0sh,Circumstances making college decision difficult,"I am an incoming freshman. All this year I had my hopes set on Kelley and I was super happy when I got in as a DA OOS (Dallas, TX). I got decent aid, about 15k a year so my cost is about 35k a year after that. Parents can pay for about half, maybe more or less. A safe estimate for my debt would be about 80k total. I plan on working part time through college as well and am going to work relentlessly to get summer internships to help as well.

In May of this year I was involved in a fairly serious car accident. My headaches from post concussion syndrome are still an issue which should resolve on their own in a few months but my back is in pretty bad shape. I am still going through PT 3 times a week for it and it hasn't been helping much. I am on various medicines for it all as well. My injuries could be worse, I'm not in a wheelchair or anything. I just have movement problems like a person in their 70s lol

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is my dilemma...

I got a full tuition offer from UT Dallas.

 It is close to home, but it is not a good business school at ALL. Like 80% of high school graduates in Dallas end up there so there really isn't much diversity and most people here end up with a degree from there. My biggest thing is that I can go to UTD for free and stick with my doctors here while I still recover. Full recovery could take a few more months or the entire school year, only time will tell. I have found good doctors very close to Bloomington so that isn't too big of an issue, it just seems like a hassle to go over there and get all new doctors and be on my own for it all without my parents who help me deal with it. Also if I go to UTD, it's easier for business so I can focus on getting a good GPA and fully recover from the accident that way I can transfer to a better program like Mccombs at UT or Mays at A&amp;M, maybe even IU.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you do in my position? Should I chase what I wanted all year and go to IU? The accident has ruined so much for me and it sucks that it's affecting where I go to college, nothing good has come out of it it's been such a headache and I hate it. Is IU worth it compared to UTD for free? I'm hoping that I can make a full recovery this school year regardless of where I go. My gut tells me IU but I'm also really nervous to take on this challenge.

Any input helps, feel free to ask me any questions. Thank you all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ows0sh/circumstances_making_college_decision_difficult/,DaBeast0111,1,2021-08-02 20:43:05,28,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ows0sh/circumstances_making_college_decision_difficult/

The show is meant to be a resource for prospective applicants, as well as highlight emerging writers. There's a lot of opaqueness around the MFA application process and we aim to provide greater information and transparency. The goal is to provide an opportunity to hear from real creative writing students about their experiences in their programs.

If you're interested, MFA Writers is free and available on all major podcasting platforms (and some minor ones too). You're always welcome to reach out to us with feedback or program requests, as well. We want this to be an informative and useful resource for emerging writers.

p7r9q1,Studio apartment or shared apartment (with random roommates)?,"Hello, I'm a grad student and I have a choice between an unfurnished, studio apartment (3rd and Union) or a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment, with randomly assigned roommates (the Avenue or Union Street Center). Both have a kitchen and both are part of school housing.

I'm a graduate student who is 28. I never lived on campus during undergrad and just lived with my parents. Now that I'm going back to school, I want to socialize a lot more. That's one reason I might lean toward the 4-bedroom shared apartment. However, I am also afraid the roommates wouldn't be a good match, then I'd be stuck with them for the year. Also, the roommates of 4 bedroom unit would likely be juniors and seniors, so I would be quite a lot older potentially. I could see there being a difference in maturity that could be difficult.

p9lwr8,Looking for a job on Campus?,"I work for UITS, which is based out of the library and I can solidly say it’s the best job on campus you can have. (Getting to become a UI or TA for a class you did well as a student is a SUPER close second. [I do both.])

I recommend applying to TCC, which handles all the in-person technical issues for UITS. Hours are flexible, they get paid extremely well, staff is awesome, and you don’t have to work for Dining, which I have heard is the worst place to work.

TCC also helps with all the computer labs and printers on campus so you learn campus well if you haven’t been at IU long.

A typical shift is 4 hours. The first hour as a regular starter is moderately busy. After the first hour you either have the rest of the shift to yourself as long as you do whatever work comes your way. If you are at a location that requires you to check labs around you, you do that once and you’re done with that task.

Base pay is $11.15 an hour for base consultants, which is $1 above minimum wage on campus and there is significant incentive for you to get raises and promotions extremely quickly.

If you’d like to apply, [here’s the link](https://kb.iu.edu/d/atjm)

If you have any other questions, I’m free to answer them!




TL;DR: Join TCC UITS they have the best pay and job on campus. Not many people think of it as a possible job for them and it flies under the radar a lot. If you know how to turn on a computer and go to a website you’re qualified.

The second issue may be even bigger but it seems none of the dining hall workers are verifying if the food is yours before you grab it. Multiple times in the past 2 weeks, myself and my friends have gotten our food snatched and we got pushed back in the digital queue.

ph291b,Justice for service workers,"
I am here hoping to address a very large problem plaguing our community. Because we live in a university town, the population of international students is exceptionally high. That being said, the sheer amount of bad behavior i have witnessed and experienced from working in various restaurants has me deeply concerned. 

Today, a group of asian college students came into my place of work which is owned by koreans from korea. I was the only server working the floor so i was managing 4-5 tables at the time of this incident. One boy demanded i take his order right that second. Being the only one there, his table was not my only responsibility so i told the table i wanted to take the drink order first. He got upset and actually followed me to the serving station using hand gestures demanding i take his order that very second. My boss saw this happening and told him because i was working solo that he would have to wait. He got angry and kicked a chair over while cursing in his native language which i believe is chinese. The owner then told him he either be respectful or leave the establishment. He then yelled that if that’s how we wanted to run our business then he was leaving. This is not an isolated incident. The other day i was cleaning a table with the dish cart and a chinese man tried to push me out of the way on his way to the bathroom. I had to tell him to walk around me instead of pushing through me. 

In the my years of living in bloomington, i have worked at several asian owned restaurants. Each time, i run into international students acting rude, entitled, and demanding while serving them. They dont respect us workers as people and take advantage any chance they get. 

Regardless of how you view servers and their responsibilities, we are still human beings and it is not in our job description to be treated like servants or slaves. Even if tips werent involved, the amount of money i make is not enough to put up with the abuse i experience every shift. I myself am 3rd generation chinese american. I understand how hard it is to be in a different country. Nothing excuses this type of behavior. 

Us americans are held to such high standards of etiquette and behavior while overseas but we dont seem to hold people coming to our country to those same standards. This isnt fair and it needs to be addressed. It’s saying something when even the owners of the restaurant are upset and cringe when FOBs come into the restaurant. They already know the trouble these customers will cause. To have that opinion of your own people is very sad. So many people are aware of our customs such as tipping but international people know they can get away with pretending to be ignorant. There was an article written on this very subject recently. People admitted to purposefully ignoring our customs because they knew they could get away with it. Even if the restaurant did wages instead of tipping, us hard workers deserve the tip for putting up with this nonsense. People dont realize the tipping isnt for bringing the food, but instead a compensation for putting up with terrible people who have no business going out to eat because they are such horrible people. The messes, the demands, the disrespect all deserve a tip. No wage will ever make up being treated as less than human. 

Im speaking on behalf of service workers. Please be respectful to us. Eating out is a privilege. It doesnt give anyone the right to come into our establishments and treat us like dirt. We are human beings who deserve respect. I dont know how to educate or make people more aware. All i know is that it is a problem and im looking for a solution.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ph291b/justice_for_service_workers/,ChibiCheeberson,1,2021-09-03 06:09:40,10,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/ph291b/justice_for_service_workers/

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/IU) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in, as well as filter courses by department and level and compare these courses. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking and know what to expect.

Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add.

Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.

pin6t2,We created a platform for IU students to easily buy and sell tickets!,"Hi Hoosiers!

We created [Aries Tickets](https://ariestickets.com/) and we are really excited to share it with you!

We, the co-founders, both graduated in Spring 2020. During our time in college, we were really frustrated with how difficult it was for students to buy and sell tickets. Using Facebook groups, GroupMe chats, and even forums like these are unintuitive, not accessible to all, and susceptible to fraud.

Thus, Aries Tickets was born. The convenient, secure ticket exchange for college students. You can buy and sell directly from the platform with safety built into the system. The first school we are supporting is IU and so the more people that use it, the more helpful it becomes!

**Tickets for the Idaho game on Saturday should get released later this week.** Just log in using your IU email and you'll be all set to exchange tickets.

Feel free to PM us or comment for feedback or questions!

Cheers!

So I figured I would outsource.
What are some hidden gem classes that you've taken at IU? Courses you were not expecting to enjoy or ones that were simply hard to find, courses with interesting or unique subjects.
I recognize that not all the courses I take will be fun, and that many courses may not be available to me depending on my school and year.

pp3ebo,Wells Scholarship,"Hi! I’m a senior form Indiana and was nominated by my Highschool for Wells. I was wondering by any chance if anyone had any idea of what the 3rd essay (really the main one) is asking? It says:

“Please formulate a question about an issue of significance about which thoughtful people disagree. Then in an original essay of approximately 600-800 words, present your analysis of the issue and your response to the question, noting the strongest competing arguments.

Please pick a topic that tells us more about yourself and your interests. We recommend that you stay away from topics that everyone has an opinion about and that have no relation to your nomination”

This seems contradictory? What type of topic am I supposed to pick? Pretty much everyone has an opinion about everything. I could say something as silly as “pineapples belong on pizza” (I would never do that for this obviously) and someone would have an opinion on that. I think almost *everyone* has an opinion on that.

pvysm9,CSCI C-200 with Brown,"I don't know if anyone on this subreddit is in this class, but this has to be said. I am so sick of this man already. I don't know if this is just how college is but, I am simply unable to get anything out his class. He just goes through slides, and fails to answer any questions that students throw at him. When students ask him valid questions about homework he answers with stuff like ""you should have learned this in elementary school"" and with incomplete sentences on Piazza (our question answering forum thing). He barely goes over the things that we do on the homework. As a result, I am forced to figure out Python completely on my own. I have to look up everything: how dictionaries work, how tuples work, how to use for loops. This is in addition to the logic I have to think about to solve questions. 

Don't get me started on office hours. I have gone to several office hours. Only one has been actually useful in helping me solve my code problems. The other ones are just them saying that they can't help because it would be ""helping me too much."" I'm 100% sure that TAs are kept on a tight leash by this professor and are being told not to give any assistance on HW. So what are they here for? I'm not asking for answers, I'm showing them code that I have already written and asking why this process is not working. ONLY ONE TA has actually gone through the code with me and actually looked at problems in my logic. 

The slides are a mess sometimes. Brown will skip slides and many have typos on them that students have to catch. In addition, Brown will do this thing where he will ask for questions and people will raise their hands. He'll not spare a look at them while they keep their hands raised and he moves onto the next slide. A slide later, people with hands raised will sheepishly put their hand down and accept their fate. 

The problem is that this is only the first or second semester that Brown is teaching this class. If he were the professor the entire time this class existed, then I wouldn't have a problem, because it would just be how it is. However, I know that a previous professor (the creator of the course)  taught it last year. He's just taking a break while Brown takes over. According to my sources, he was a way better professor that explained things properly and in depth.

C200 is a intro computer science class, and while I understand the need to weedout the students, I feel like the professor and TA should be more helpful when we come to them with questions. I have not seen a single question answered throughly. I'm still treading water, but I'm truly afraid of when I finally run out of stamina and drown in this pool where the lifeguards just stand by and watch. 

It's truly frightening when you go to lecture and a person sitting next you tells you that they feel helpless. 

Do I speak to him directly? Do I talk to an advisor?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/pvysm9/csci_c200_with_brown/,CrazedNarwhal,1,2021-09-26 13:56:31,19,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/pvysm9/csci_c200_with_brown/

[RateMyFood](https://ratemyfood.tech/), a web application, is essentially RateMyProfessor, but for campus food, which means you can use it to find and add reviews for campus food!

We built this because early on at IU it was kind of difficult to gauge what food was good and what was not, so we hope this helps with that!

We haven’t added all the dining halls to the website yet (like Forest and McNutt), but if you guys want, we can definitely do that. Also, it would be awesome if you guys could drop a few reviews on the website and share this with your friends! 

Let us know what you guys think about it and if you would like some other features to be added to it! We are very excited for this, and hope it helps you all!

q263fm,Filling the activity section,"Hi!

I'm an international student applying to IU Bloomington via EA this fall. I was wondering about the activities section in the IU's application - from what I've seen, there are only 30 characters available for a description of each activity (which, if chosen out of a premade list, is quite vague to say at least) - is there any way to go around it? And is there any good way to provide an accurate explanation in so few words, or does IU somehow prefer the common app?

q2zlxg,"For the average international CS major that has a 3.3 GPA, how do you go about getting scholarships?","Hi all!

International student here. I'm thinking of majoring in computer science at Indiana University. However, it's expensive to attend for an international student. I'm thinking of applying to some scholarships to help decrease my financial burden while I pursue a rigorous education. I don't think I'm an outstanding student, so I predict that I would only be able to get average grades since there are many smart people around.

Nonetheless, I think I should still try my best to apply to scholarships. I've looked at many resources about scholarships located in the university's website as well as others.

Unfortunately, I'm really overwhelmed by all the information and need some help. Most important to me is that I'm not sure how to effectively and efficiently go about getting scholarships that suit my circumstances.

Or should I just drop out of IU and wait til next fall lol? (The only reason why I haven’t already left is because I have a dorm) 


(THIS IS A RANT FEEL FREE TO SKIP) 
        
        Im not doing bad at IU academically but I’m not doing that great either. Im not a fan of the environment or the overall partying either lol. I feel like the whole traditional college experience is just not for me and I’m wasting my money being here. I wanted to go here to get away from Indianapolis but being here has made me miss the “community-feel” of the city (something I thought I would never say). Not trying to shit on anyone from Bloomington, I’m sure it’s only a few people but the majority of people I have personally encountered here have been rude asf when it comes to common courtesy. I also know more people who go to IUPUI and I feel like it’ll be a better fit for me. It works financially and it’s close enough for me to help out my mom and get a decent paying job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/q8qfpl/transferring_to_iupui/,Forward-Dealer1414,1,2021-10-15 11:09:41,25,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/q8qfpl/transferring_to_iupui/

q90a7k,Some Poor Planning,"Hello. So, my 2 friends and I are Ohio State students who are coming over to Indiana this weekend to watch the OSU IU game. We bought tickets, however, we didn’t really/kind of forget to book a hotel room. So the hotel rooms are kind of expensive like as in $1,000 per night and on top of that they are actually all fully booked which is obviously a very sad reality for 3 college students. So if anybody has like a dorm or apartment floor that we could sleep on Saturday night (and maybe Friday night too) that would be really cool. We will give you $150 total per night. All we want is to sleep on your floor. We won’t bother you if you don’t want to be bothered and we will also bring you beer and let you drink our liquor if you do want to be bothered. If we see you at the bar first round is definitely on us and second too. And if we come back to sleep on the floor and you guys are still up/bored we will order and pay for pizza. 

If you’re willing to help us out PM me. I can give you me and my friends Instagram/Snap/phone number or whatever to prove I’m legit and not some random creep.

Now, I have violated my F1 status due to which my SEVIS record will be terminated and I need to reinstate it by either 1. making a pardon request to USCIS or
2. getting a new i-20/SEVIS record and travelling out and coming back to US.

I am confused if this could be averted or if not, which option to take. The pardon petition may take months and I wont be able to work or go out of US in that duration. It may even get rejected. And if I leave and come back to US, I may get questioned at the port of entry and in the worst case can be sent back to my country since I have previously held an unauthorised work position.

qadfge,Transferring to IU after one semester?,"I’m currently a freshman going to Ball State and I was wondering if I’d be able to transfer to IU come this spring semester? I’ve realized after a couple of months I’m just not entirely happy with my decision — the school is small and boring, there’s never anything going on, the journalism program is lackluster and the newspaper pales in comparison to IDS — and I’ve been thinking a lot about transferring to IU where I can be a part of a great community, a great program and explore the opportunities this school has to offer. I have an older sister who went to IU, so I’m very accustomed to campus and everything she was able to achieve when she went here. 

I was already accepted my senior year of high school, so I’m not too concerned about that part of the application process. But will I be able to apply now, even though I haven’t earned 12 credit hours yet? Even if I’ll have 14 by the end of the semester? I’m not entirely certain how the application process works — and I’m not 100 percent certain I’m even going to apply before the Nov. 1 deadline — but I want to have an idea of what I can do before I make any sort of definitive decision.

qkamlj,Free Mock Interview Simulator,"Over the past few months I’ve been trying to build a mock interview simulator ([www.preparo.net](http://www.preparo.net/)).

It tries to mimic an interview being done virtually.

The reason I built it is when I was preparing for my graduate interviews in tech companies I absolutely fumbled my way through the first ten interviews before I finally actually got a job and I put a lot of it down to being quite stressed and filled with nerves because I just wasn't properly prepared for it.

I lost out on a significant amount of time working and salaries due to not being good at interviews. I wanted to fix that by building an online interview prep system.

I’ve loaded in over 20,000 random interview questions from industry experts and you can select to do interviews by competency, behavioural or randomly. You can also load in your own questions you anticipate might come up.

qldfx3,Bike racks next to Ballantine Hall unsafe?,"I'm a student at IU and I ride my bike to class everyday. I find myself all over campus, but especially over at Ballantine Hall. I have classes there Monday-Friday. So, I've taken up the habit of locking my bike at the racks next to the building. The ones that are between the west wall of the building (the one facing towards the Chemistry Department) and a patch of forest.

However, I've noticed what appears to be the remains of stolen bikes/bike parts still locked the racks. It started on October 19th (I only remember the exact date because I messaged my boyfriend that day about this). I locked my bike, left to go to class, and when I came back two bikes in front of mine had been seemingly tampered with. There was a front wheel still locked to the rack as well as a bike frame missing its front wheel. I thought it was strange. I also remembered seeing someone acting kind of suspicious before I went to class. But I thought I was overthinking it and went about my day.

Since then, more bikes locked at that area have been messed with, seemingly. More front wheels left behind. I don't have any proof that things were stolen, but no matter how you look at it, that seems to be the case, right? All this to say, does anyone have any information on this? I swear there are about 3 bike wheels down there now as well as a bike frame. The same wheel and bike frame that I noticed on the 19th are still there.

If they have been stolen, is there anyone we can contact about this? Like, someone with the school? Because if there have been several stolen/tampered with bikes at the same spot, that seems like something that should be remedied, right?

I've been anxious about locking my own bike there because I don't want it to be stolen. I've already had a bike stolen in this town before, so I haven't been able to stop worrying about it. I'm hoping I'm just overthinking things.

If people actually had their bikes taken apart/stolen, I'm sorry about that.

qod1kp,Math/Business combination?,"Hey,

I'm a student at Umich and my cousin is a senior in high school who applied to to IU and Umich. He wants to do the dual degree thing with math and Kelley or math and the business school (Ross) at umich. Obviously he hasn't gotten in but I'm pretty sure he'll be a direct admit to Kelley and Ross. I just wanted to get a comprehensive feel for the math department at IU. He's in state for Indiana and has been dual enrolled for math( has credit for Calc 1-3, Linear Algebra, and differential equations; got a 4.0 in all of them) so IU is definitely the cheaper option. The biggest factor in which school he attends has more to do with the differences in the math curriculum/teaching/opportunities and tuition more than Kelley vs Ross. If anyone has some familiarity with both math departments, that would be very helpful. I can provide the syllabi for the standard honors sequence at Umich and here's a rough overview: 

\-first semester(Munkres,Spivak):

Axioms of the real numbers, completeness and connectedness in the real line.  Functions of a real variable, limits and continuity, uniform continuity, extreme and intermediate value theorems, differentiation, integration, the fundamental theorem of calculus, Taylor's theorem with remainder.

\-second semester(Hoffman and Kunze):

Sequences and series of functions, power series, uniform convergence, real analytic functions. Vector spaces, bases, linear transformations, dual spaces, determinants, traces, eigenvalues, inner-product spaces, spectral theory.  Limits and continuity in Euclidean space, derivative as a linear map, Chain Rule, inverse/implicit function theorems.

\-third semester(Munkres Analysis, Tao intro to measure theory, Hoffman and kunze)):

Inverse/implicit function theorems, immersion/submersion theorems.  Quotient and dual spaces, inner product spaces, spectral theory.  Metric spaces, basic point-set topology. Integration in Euclidean space, Fubini's theorem, change of variables formula. Topics in linear algebra: tensor products, exterior and symmetric powers, Jordan and rational canonical forms.

\-fourth semester:

Submanifolds (with or without corners) of Euclidean space, abstract manifolds, tangent and cotangent spaces, immersion/submersion theorems. Partitions of unity, vector fields and differential forms on manifolds, exterior differentiation, integration of differential forms.  Stokes' theorem.  deRham cohomology, Riemannian metrics, Hodge star operator and the standard vector calculus versions of Stokes' theorem.

and the optional algebra courses:

\-algebra 1:

The course covers basic definitions and properties of groups, fields, and vector spaces including homomorphisms, isomorphisms, subgroups, and bilinear forms.

Further topics are selected from: Sylow theorems; structure theorem for finitely-generated abelian groups; permutation representation; the symmetric and alternating groups; vector spaces over arbitrary fields; spectral theorem; and linear groups.

\-algebra 2:

covers basic definitions and properties of rings and modules including quotients, ideals, factorization, and field extensions. Further topics are selected from: representation theory; structure theory of modules over a PID; Jordan canonical form; Galois theory, Nullstellensatz; finite fields; Euclidean, Principal ideals, and unique factorization domains; polynomial rings in one and several variables; and algebraic varieties.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/qod1kp/mathbusiness_combination/,Jazzlike-Split1354,1,2021-11-06 20:25:29,1,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/qod1kp/mathbusiness_combination/

Now imagine if you got fired from somewhere for this reason. Would you come back and start hanging around your former place of employment where you were fired for cause? No, because that's sad. What's even more confusing in this analogy is that the school is welcoming him in.

Bob Knight is a bully and should find somewhere else to spend his time.

**Roland KC-100 4-Channel Keyboard Combo** - Honestly might change my mind about selling this one at any moment because it's a such great combination of portable/loud/versatile - $200

**Behringer BXL 3000** - Played lots of basement shows with this one.  Still works great - $150

**Casio LK-73** - This is a nice keyboard.  Lots of different options.  I had a lot of fun running this + an analog synth through the Roland.  Comes with a stand - $175

- are the costs (in the website) per person? Or per room and distributed between roommates?

- if cost is distributed per semester or per academic year. What's it gonna be like if im planning to stay summer? Whether I will or won't take summer classes

- does the dorm im staying in match me with a roommate or do I have to find my own? Or is there anything else to how it work?

- for my first year do I need to stay just on campus or specifically an IU dorm? Am I ok with staying at an apartment like say campus view?

- which are the most favored halls?

*Dining*

- how long typically will a dining plan last? Or how long SHOULD it last?

- which plan is the best option? Keeping in mind I'm an athlete and I eat quite heavily.

- where are the dining halls in relation to housing halls? Are they inside each housing hall? Are the separate on their own? (Asking this cuz I will need to know if it comes to living somewhere that might be a little far from dining halls)

- would the meal plans be worth opting-into after the first/second year? (Idk how to cook, but I'm for sure planning to learn)

- which housing/dining halls have the best dining options? (Food quality and variety of options) or do all dining halls have the same options available?

I have a BA in Public Affairs from a no-name college on the east coast and was pleasantly surprised to be admitted to IU and O'Neill as well as a few other well-regarded programs. But even with fellowships, attending IU would cost me almost double the cheapest program I got into, also another major Midwest state school with a reputable Public Affairs department, though not as highly-ranked as O'Neill.

I've spoken to a few local O'Neill MPA alums and they all love the program, but I'm not sure the network out here is strong enough to justify spending double on a degree.

r7o2u5,"Help with Kelley, Selective Scholarships","Hi, I’m very confused about scholarships and have received conflicting info from IU sources and want to get an opinion on my chances when it comes to scholarships. I am an Indiana high school student.
A couple months ago my high school counselor said I automatically qualify for direct admit to Kelley, and I got that email yesterday.  I have a 1500 SAT, National Merit, and a 4.4 weighted GPA. When I called IU, the person in admissions didn’t even know that a Kelley major always takes precedence and becomes the ‘major’ major, even if you’re double majoring, so she was not much help. My letter did not contain the specified 1-8k scholarship offer, and today I was told that that would come in a couple weeks…I’m very nervous because some of my friends got it along with their admission letter.
I was informed today less than 1% of Kelley admits receive the selective scholarship option, so I don’t think I would get it. Also today, a separate woman from admissions said that if I did not get a letter specifying an amount of money WITH my admission letter, it means I did not receive any ‘automatic’ scholarship money. Literally instantly after a different IU representative said that was not true.

TLDR: my questions are
1: Did other Kelley admits get their ‘automatic’ scholarship offer already?
2: it seems pretty hard to get scholarships in Kelley. Is there any way I can get a good amount of scholarship money considering I probably would not qualify for need-based ones? 
3: out of 4 IU reps, 2 have gotten major pieces of info wrong when talking to me. Has anyone else had issues like this?
4: I pretty much definitely won’t get selective scholarships, right?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/r7o2u5/help_with_kelley_selective_scholarships/,y2kbutmakeitspicy,1,2021-12-02 21:32:44,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/r7o2u5/help_with_kelley_selective_scholarships/

r80d57,Looking for a Job on Campus?,"I work for UITS, which is based out of the library and I can solidly say it’s the best job on campus you can have. (Getting to become a UI or TA for a class you did well as a student is a SUPER close second. [I do both.])

I recommend applying to TCC, which handles all the in-person technical issues for UITS. Hours are flexible, they get paid extremely well, staff is awesome, and you don’t have to work for Dining, which I have heard is the worst place to work.

TCC also helps with all the computer labs and printers on campus so you learn campus well if you haven’t been at IU long.

A typical shift is 4 hours. The first hour as a regular starter is moderately busy. After the first hour you either have the rest of the shift to yourself as long as you do whatever work comes your way or, if you are at a location that requires you to check labs around you, you do that once and you’re done with that task.

Base pay is $12.15 an hour for base consultants, which is $2 above minimum wage on campus and there is significant incentive for you to get raises and promotions extremely quickly if that's something that you shoot for.

If you’d like to apply, [here’s the link](https://kb.iu.edu/d/atjm)

If you have any other questions, I’m free to answer them!


TL;DR: Join TCC UITS they have the best pay and job on campus. Not many people think of it as a possible job for them and it flies under the radar a lot. If you know how to turn on a computer and go to a website you’re qualified.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **FAQ**

** Q: Is there anything you'd recommend putting in the application to increase chances of an interview?**
A: The good thing about TCC is that expertise in technical fields are not required AT ALL. As an applicant, a willingness to learn is huge because UITS has internal documentation on EVERYTHING so you’re never clueless. But, that does mean your first couple days are going to be chalk full of asking questions as well as reading up on procedures and skills that you’ll be learning, growing, and using throughout your employment. If you have a good attitude, are a reliable individual, and are willing to listen and learn, you will bag the job and you definitely won’t regret it.

**Q: When I applied i got a mail saying they do most of their recruiting in September October, one question i have is what is their normal time they reply back for an application ?**
A: Unsurprisingly, due to the last year here at IU, the answer to this question is more complicated than it really should be.
Because of COVID and the fact that TCC wasn’t able to recruit in person, UITS and IU has really looked to them to gain more employees quickly because of the increase in demand for any technical support. (You can imagine with everyone on Zoom why UITS was really busy this past year.) Because of this push for more employees, TCC was given an raise in wages on a department-wide scale to make it more appetizing for potential applicants as well as incentivize more people to stay (even if TCC does not have a retention problem).
In addendum to this, TCC is more than likely going to recruit on a more frequent basis this school year. Typically, there is a big hire at the beginning of each semester and then a smaller batch of employees come to join the team about 3/4 into the semester as well. (This totals a rough estimate of 4 times a year people can expect to be hired at TCC.) But, this year, there will probably instead be a continuous onboarding of new employees to the point at which there are a variety of opportunities to join the team. Typically a followup email to the HR department 3 days after your application to TCC could lend more details on what your specific onboarding future looks like.
The email for TCC HR: tcchr@iu.edu
Side Note: The specific email you got is probably outdated and automated so I wouldn’t take it too seriously.

**Q: The application shows an option for up to 3 references and 3 work employer references, are all 3 required? I've only worked one job previous to this one and getting in touch with my employer would be a bit difficult. Also, when is the application due so I can let my references know. Also, are the hours flexible?**
A: Hours are flexible, and references are not required.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/r80d57/looking_for_a_job_on_campus/,its_the_anorak,1,2021-12-03 09:31:25,6,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/r80d57/looking_for_a_job_on_campus/

rcmovc,"Survey | Pedestrians, Drivers, and Cyclists on 10th St."," Hi r/IndianaUniversity!

I’m -eastmain-, an undergraduate student majoring in design. For our final project, me and my group mates have been tasked with designing a just solution to a designed experience on Indiana University’s campus. To best address our target audience, we decided to go straight to the source with a survey posted here and on r/Bloomington. 

My group has chosen to address the area of 10th Street between the Kelley School of Business and the Herman B. Wells Library. Our survey is intended to gather information on who passes through this area of 10th Street, when they pass through it, and what their experiences are like doing so. The survey is all multiple choice, aside from an optional short answer response at the end--and of course, no personal information is being gathered. It should only take a few minutes to complete.

Thank you for your participation, we look forward to seeing your responses!

rd4zhu,"How is Computer Science at IUB? (Luddy school, BS CS)","I read a post where a lot of people say a CS degree from IUB is pretty useless and a waste of money, and that they teach nothing and have terrible teachers/professors.

But then in another post I read some people say it's very good and they really like it there

I asked 2 of my friends that graduated from IUB (not CS) and they said that the uni is good and it's a fun and great place to be in. When I asked them about CS they said that ut was good and that it's pretty new there (the luddy school. They graduated a whole ago, not recent grads, but not sure when exactly)

So like... is CS at IUB good or not? What are the pros and cons of it? And what would I expect if I went there?

If any past/current IUB computer science students can give any insight or feedback I'd really appreciate that.

Thx &lt;3

PS: please keep in mind I wanna know about computer science mainly. I don't think I wanna choose any other major, even if it might be somewhat related or close to CS in someway. I'm most likely gonna look into becoming a software engineer.

I am moving to Indiana as well (as of right now only for 6 months as I’m only taking a semester off here at OSU). I am wanting to earn my degree fully online and OSU does not offer that.

It’s called Business Information Systems, so if IU offers something like that please let me know! 

I also have a full ride scholarship here at OSU, and I am wondering how likely will it be that I receive one here as well? I understand that I am very fortunate enough to have received this and some will tell me I should just stay here but I’ve grown to hate where I live as it is extremely depressing here on campus and in the city of Columbus. My mental health has suffered severely in the past year and a half of being here.

I've been to both campuses but never been completely in love with either. I didn't have the best experience at IU, as any college a few minutes off the main campus becomes pretty ghetto and we didn't have the best food at this one sit down we went to while there.

2) Indiana University Bloomington (MSDS): The curriculum is great but location wise it's very isolated. The living expenses are relatively cheap. I want to know if it's difficult to find internships/jobs/opportunities because of this reason

3) Syracuse University (MS in Applied Data Science):  I have been offered a 30 Percent SCHOLARSHIP on tuition thus making it a not so expensive option plus  I Consult and *NYS CASE* (where international students get to work with companies(off-campus) legally), seems like a great opportunity to me 

4) SDSU (MS in Big Data Analytics): It's in California, need I say more?

5)  SUNY Buffalo: MPS in Data Science And Applications: I am not sure about it\~

6) Penn State great Valley (MPS in Data Analytics): Location seems good, although I couldn't find much info about the university, all I know is that this university is not in the same league as university park.

sn25ni,Indiana University Names New Legal Chief After GC's Ouster,"https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2022/02/07/indiana-university-names-new-legal-chief-after-gcs-ouster/

&gt; **What You Need to Know**
&gt; * Indiana University has named veteran employment defense lawyer Anthony Prather as general counsel.
&gt; * He succeeds Jacqueline Simmons, who split with IU while butting heads with a law professor at the school.
&gt; * Indiana's public access counselor issued in an opinion Monday that IU violated the state's Open Door Law.

...

&gt; Prather will succeed ex-general counsel Jacqueline Simmons on Feb. 22, pending approval from IU’s board of trustees. IU was poised to fire Simmons[poised to fire Simmons](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2022/01/21/indiana-university-planned-to-fire-general-counsel-before-retirement-agreement/), but later agreed to let her retire as part of a $175,000 separation agreement. She had served as the school’s GC for nearly nine years.  

&gt; Simmons stepped down in December, after she hired Indianapolis-based Hoover Hull Turner to search the university email account of tenured IU law professor Steve Sanders in an apparent attempt to identify the anonymous sources he cited in a report that was critical of the process that led to the appointment of the school’s new president, Pamela Whitten.

&gt; Sanders’ unnamed sources included a search committee member and a candidate for the IU presidency. 

...

&gt; Sanders has questioned why Whitten secured the president’s seat at IU despite having not been among the four presidential finalists that IU’s search committee originally brought to the school’s board of trustees. 

...

&gt; Public Access Counselor Luke Britt ... determined that IU had violated the Open Door Law and noted that “a governing body cannot take final action on public business during an executive session.”  

&gt; “To be sure,” Britt concluded, “despite IU’s casualness regarding high-dollar contracts, a contract extension or consulting agreement worth over $500,000 to a single employee is undoubtedly an action item that would need authorization via final action and warrant discussion in an open meeting.” 

...

&gt; Sanders said he is concerned about the optics of IU tapping a management-side labor and employment lawyer to serve as legal chief, especially as the school’s graduate student workers push to unionize.  

&gt; “We can only hope he appreciates that universities are unique institutions with numerous constituencies, including faculty, and that the lawyer for a university cannot come to the job with the same mindset as the lawyer representing management of a big private corporation,” Sanders wrote in an email. 

&gt; He also noted that Prather’s resume indicates a dearth of experience “with the myriad other kinds of matters a university general counsel faces—First Amendment, intellectual property, government compliance, Title IX, legislative affairs, shared governance, student conduct.”

&gt; “He will have to navigate both running a legal shop and advising a board of trustees that is long accustomed to flouting state open-meetings law,” Sanders added.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/sn25ni/indiana_university_names_new_legal_chief_after/,saryl,1,2022-02-07 16:54:50,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/sn25ni/indiana_university_names_new_legal_chief_after/

sq1oli,Looking for a Job On Campus?,"I work for UITS, which is based out of the Herman B. Wells Library, and I can solidly say it’s the best job on campus you can have. (Getting to become a UI or TA for a class you did well as a student is a SUPER close second. [I do both.])

I recommend applying to TCC, which handles all the in-person technical issues for UITS. Hours are flexible, they get paid extremely well, staff is awesome, and you don’t have to work for Dining, which I have heard is the worst place to work.

TCC also helps with all the computer labs and printers on campus so you learn campus well if you haven’t been at IU/IUPUI long.

A typical shift is 4 hours. The first hour as a regular starter is moderately busy. After the first hour you either have the rest of the shift to yourself as long as you do whatever work comes your way or, if you are at a location that requires you to check labs around you, you do that once and you’re done with that task.

Base pay is $12.15 an hour for base consultants, which is above minimum wage on campus and there is significant incentive for you to get raises and promotions extremely quickly if that's something that you shoot for.

If you’d like to apply, [here’s the link](https://kb.iu.edu/d/atjm)

If you have any other questions, I’m free to answer them!


TL;DR: Join TCC UITS they have the best pay and job on campus. Not many people think of it as a possible job for them and it flies under the radar a lot. If you know how to turn on a computer, go to a website, and read, you're qualified.

# **FAQ**

### **Q: Is there anything you'd recommend putting in the application to increase chances of an interview?**
A: The good thing about TCC is that expertise in technical fields are not required AT ALL. As an applicant, a willingness to learn is huge because UITS has internal documentation on EVERYTHING so you’re never clueless. But, that does mean your first couple days are going to be chalk full of asking questions as well as reading up on procedures and skills that you’ll be learning, growing, and using throughout your employment. If you have a good attitude, are a reliable individual, and are willing to listen and learn, you will bag the job and you definitely won’t regret it.

### **Q: When I applied I got an email saying they do most of their recruiting in September/October, one question I have is what is the normal time they reply back for an application?**
A: Unsurprisingly, due to the last year here at IU, the answer to this question is more complicated than it really should be.
Because of COVID and the fact that TCC wasn’t able to recruit in person, UITS and IU has really looked to them to gain more employees quickly because of the increase in demand for any technical support. (You can imagine with everyone on Zoom why UITS was really busy this past year.) Because of this push for more employees, TCC was given a raise in wages on a department-wide scale to make it more appetizing for potential applicants as well as incentivize more people to stay (even though TCC UITS does not have a retention problem).
In addendum to this, TCC is more than likely going to recruit on a more frequent basis this school year. Typically, there is a big hire at the beginning of each semester and then a smaller batch of employees come to join the team about 3/4 into the semester as well. (This totals a rough estimate of 4 times a year people can expect to be hired at TCC.) But, this year, there will probably instead be a continuous onboarding of new employees to the point at which there are a variety of opportunities to join the team. Typically a followup email to the HR department a week after your application to TCC could lend more details on what your specific onboarding future looks like.

Side Note: The specific email you got is probably outdated and automated so I wouldn’t take it too seriously.

### **Q: The application shows an option for up to 3 references and 3 work employer references, are all 3 required? I've only worked one job previous to this one and getting in touch with my employer would be a bit difficult. Also, when is the application due so I can let my references know. Also, are the hours flexible?**
A: Hours are flexible, and references are not required.

### **Q: I recently got an interview opportunity, there's a paper IT knowledge test. How hard is it and what do I need to know?**
A: The test is just a gauge to see how much you know about IT at IU. Personally, if you know how to connect to the WiFi and know how to access [the Knowledge Base](https://kb.iu.edu), you are over prepared and should not be worried at all. The interview and your chances of being hired are heavily wighted towards the more behavioral questions in the interview and any experience you may have in customer service.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/sq1oli/looking_for_a_job_on_campus/,its_the_anorak,1,2022-02-11 10:13:55,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/sq1oli/looking_for_a_job_on_campus/

You don’t have to scroll through thousands of opportunities like you do with job boards; instead, you can generate your own matches that the AI finds for you. I love it because it takes under five minutes to apply to each company and get your profile in front of a recruiter—and you’ll actually hear back rather than getting ghosted by job boards.

sre6vp,Question for the international students,"I recently got into Kelley for management. I literally have the option to go to uni anywhere, ranging from US-Canada, Europe to even Australia. The reason for me to seriously consider IU or the States in general is the social scene which is quite while marketed in all the American pop culture content most of us have consumed. IU ranks in the 300s when it comes to world rankings too but the reason for me to consider it seriously is the apparent prestige Kelley holds in country according to US News rankings. My question for the international students is regarding the social life. How close to reality is the content on Netflix? Is it just full of parties and rude frat boys bullying people around? How hard is it to assimilate with the local crowd?

st8ihj,(New information) Indiana University trustees violated open door law with Michael McRobbie payment approval,"https://www.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/2022/02/15/iu-indiana-university-trustees-violated-open-door-law-michael-mcrobbie-deal-bloomington/6702680001/

&gt; The ruling from Luke Britt found that IU had taken final action on public business during an executive session, which is forbidden by the open door law.

...

&gt; While the public access counselor's decision is unlikely to lead to any punishment for IU, Britt indicated some impatience with the university.

&gt; ""IU’s argument that the agreement was not an extension but rather a whole new 'consulting' contract only exacerbates the matter,"" Britt wrote.

...

&gt; Rulings in three public access counselor cases filed in 2021 all went against IU. The year ended with the university parting ways with Jacqueline Simmons, an IU vice president and its general counsel.

...

&gt; The state's public access counselor is a non-partisan officer. Britt was appointed by then-Gov. Mike Pence in 2013. According to the state's website, the office is ""dedicated to preserving the access rights of the public and educating government officials on their responsibilities under Indiana’s access laws.""

&gt; In separate opinions, Britt found IU failed to follow Indiana's Access to Public Records Act.

...

&gt; Britt determined the university took longer than was reasonable to respond to IU law professor Steve Sanders' request for documents related to the trustees approval of the McRobbie insurance policy.

&gt; **Britt also decided the university violated public access laws when it denied Indiana Daily Student reporter Cate Charron's public records request for the disciplinary record of a student who was accused of committing a sexual assault.**

&gt; Charron initially filed two requests in September, asking for the student's disciplinary record dating back to 2015 and a copy of an alleged victim's Title IX case file. IU improperly invoked the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act when denying Charron's request.

&gt; Charron appealed last November. She knew she had a strong case, but it was unfamiliar territory. While she doesn't expect things to change at the university level, she hopes some good can come from the process that led to the public access counselor's decision in her favor.

&gt; ""I want other student journalists and other journalists to know that we can go through this process, and there can be a result like this,"" she said. ""I got a lot of help from other people and this was kind of a win for the whole newsroom.""

...

&gt; In an interview with the H-T, Steve Sanders said there might be reason for some concern for IU. ""This is at least a third case in the last four months that the university has lost in that office,"" he said.

&gt; Sanders thought the open door law ruling was a more extreme example of larger trends within the board of trustees.

&gt; ""The Board of Trustees probably violates the open door law every time they meet,"" Sanders said. ""They almost certainly discuss things routinely in executive session that they shouldn't be. If you go to the meetings, they have a kind of scripted feel to them, where you can tell things have been talked about and worked out. All the questions asked and answered in advance.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/st8ihj/new_information_indiana_university_trustees/,saryl,1,2022-02-15 12:39:27,2,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/st8ihj/new_information_indiana_university_trustees/

suciq0,The Futurist Society," 

Hello everyone!

My name is Damian, and I'm an aerospace engineering student at UC Irvine. I've created a club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We discuss flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We are building a Wiki of many types of future tech as a resource for people looking to know more about technology. We also have plans to start doing projects as our organization gets more established.

Right now there is no chapter being formed at this school, but we are always looking for people to help us start new ones! Being one of our leaders could be a great opportunity in shaping your resume and in making connections! We also welcome anyone who just wants to join for our discussions.

We have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! If you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!

sup5l3,IU makes no formal commitments after meeting with student climate groups,"https://www.idsnews.com/article/2022/02/iu-makes-no-formal-commitments-after-meeting-with-student-climate-groups

&gt; Representatives from IU Student Government, Students for a Green New World and Sunrise Bloomington met with IU President Pamela Whitten and JT Forbes, the IU Foundation President, on Feb. 9 to discuss IU’s climate goals.

&gt; The student representatives left the meeting feeling frustrated with the lack of progress made, SNGW President Sidd Das said.  

&gt; “I was disappointed with the IU administration and the new president,” Das said. “There has been no formal commitment to creating a climate action plan.” 

&gt; During the meeting, President Whitten mentioned she has asked Tom Morrison, the vice president of capital planning, to form a committee to address long term climate goals but did not provide details such as a timeline or who would be on the committee, Das said. 

&gt; Morrison put emphasis on smaller actions, such as making buildings more energy efficient or using electric cars, Das said.

&gt; **Updates on the meeting with President Whitten and IUF President JT Forbes**

&gt; IU President Whitten emphasized personal responsibility of students and faculty to reduce university carbon emissions, but did not commit to supporting fossil fuel divestment.

&gt; When asked by Sunrise Bloomington whether the IU foundation plans to divest from fossil fuels, IU Foundation President J.T. Forbes did not answer our question.

&gt; Forbes stated that he would only discuss the issue if Sunrise Bloomington collaborated with student and faculty governance. Student and Faculty governments have since 2014 passed resolutions asking IU Foundation to divest with no response from IUF.

&gt; Moving forward: Sunrise Bloomington along with other student orgs will continue to attempt scheduling further meetings with the IU Foundation and IU administration to discuss fossil fuel divestment and a comprehensive climate action plan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/sup5l3/iu_makes_no_formal_commitments_after_meeting_with/,saryl,1,2022-02-17 08:45:01,10,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/sup5l3/iu_makes_no_formal_commitments_after_meeting_with/

2. Culture- What is the culture like? Is there an increased emphasis on greek and frat life or is there an emphasis on academics and sports as well?
3. Social- Is the student body generally divided into ethnic or national groups, such as Indians forming groups with Indians exclusively, or is there diversity? Are racism and hate crimes a problem there, especially during nighttime?
4. Eateries and facilities- What are the eateries like in Bloomington in terms of international cuisines? Are there sufficient nearby grocery stores and pharmacies? What about common hang-out spots?
5. Transportation- What is their transportation system like? Is it necessary to use cars or taxis or is there an efficient bus or train system in place? What is the cheapest and the most efficient mode of communication, both inside Bloomington and while traveling to nearby cities for leisure or work purposes?

tixv7j,Out of state tuition,"Hello,

About 10 years ago I came up 2 semesters short of a degree. I was attending Indiana University Bloomington as an in-state student and had to pull out due to some financial difficulties. Now at 33, I’m really trying hard to finish my degree, but I’ve been living in Chicago since leaving school, so I’d have to pay out of state tuition this time around. I was hoping to go this fall 2022, so I applied for fafsa and was granted $12500 federal loan, and $6000 pell grant. In order to finish school id need about a 15k private to cover the remaining cost to get me to the $35k out of state tuition. 

I’d really love to find a way to just have to pay in state tuition for my last year since its only $11k. IU admissions told me I only have to live in the state for a year before I can get instate tuition, but my primary reason for moving there cant be education. Im thinking about moving to Indianapolis this summer for a year and trying to attend IU in fall 2023. 

I currently work a warehouse with an Indy location, so I’m thinking I can try to transfer there.  Would this suffice the requirement of not moving there for education? I also have a lot of friends in Indy from my time at school, so I’d also try to tell them I moved there to be in a cheaper city, closer to friends and loved ones. How do they check these things? Are they very strict? Id imagine they are, and Id hate to move there for a year, only to find out I still have to pay out of state tuition. If I lived there for a year and they still made me pay out of state tuition, I would probably just have to transfer my credits to an IL school, but would I be considered in state for an IL school, if I spent the last year in Indy?

This led to conversations about other things such as how we do mental math, what we think when we take exams (this was an eye-opener), and how we study/work.

I'm currently a senior and going to graduate soon so it doesn't REALLY matter, but it's nice to have peace of mind (or maybe find out I might not be so normal after all).",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/tjx7z6/can_iu_caps_diagnose_you/,CursedPoro,1,2022-03-22 03:10:45,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/tjx7z6/can_iu_caps_diagnose_you/

- When it comes to the dorms, what type of things came in handy that you never would of thought to have with you? (I’ve never lived in a dorm before, and my room at home is rather spacious). 

- Again, the dorms- I don’t really mind having a communal bathroom or roomies or anything like that- but do we have the ability to cook in a kitchen? Is that type of thing in all the dorms? (I really don’t want to get a meal plan if I don’t have too, but I have to be able to cook!) 

- is a bike a good idea? A lot of people have said that everything on campus is no more than a 10-15 minute walk away, but I won’t have a car and I know Indiana winters can be pretty cold so… is it worth bringing a bike? 

- I know there are quite a lot of restaurants around, and I plan on working as well as attending school. I assume the employers of these places are pretty flexible since the majority of the town are students? What are your experiences with work while attending IU?

I’m sure I’ll have more questions but I wanted to get these out of the way for now.

tx3s1e,Questions from a parent of a likely incoming freshman,"First, my thanks to all those who are providing good information and constructive commentary on this sub. It's extremely helpful.

Second, I'm an IU grad student alum ('97) whose son is almost certainly going to choose IU for his undergraduate program. Obviously a lot has changed in the past twenty-five years--especially in the past three--and I have a couple of questions.

(1) Food: During my time at IU, I always felt the dining halls and other campus food options were good to great in choice, quality, and cost. I lived in Eigenmann, and I still contemplate the outstanding deli in the basement (most assuredly long gone) with more fervor than is probably healthy a quarter century later. I also enjoyed meals in pretty much every dining hall on campus. Unfortunately, I've read in a couple of places (not only on this sub) that my experience just isn't true anymore. There are even implications that the university is using covid as cover to more or less ""extort"" money from students--i.e., less choice and lower quality at high cost. I'm stunned that covid could still be a university excuse this late in the pandemic game for much of anything, but especially something as crucial as food service. Could anyone please comment on their experiences regarding the current dining situation at IU? Does it seem to be getting any better? Has the university made any public commitments to returning to pre-pandemic standards at some point?

(2) General assholery: There seems to be far more harassment happening on campus than I remember. The pandemic certainly has highlighted and encouraged the latent prickmeister in a disturbingly high number of people, but is there more going on than that? This is probably not quantifiable, and if it's nothing more than traditional frat bro juvenile self-loathing, then that's certainly and sadly nothing new. I just want to make sure campus culture hasn't devolved radically since I was there.

(3) Not a question, but if anyone has any hard-won advice or suggestions for an incoming IU freshman in fall 2022--on any topic dear to you--I'd love to read them.

txxmox,Music Business at IU,"As a current sophomore interested in pursuing a career in the music industry, I’m really quite baffled that there is no proper music business or commercial music program at IU. Considering Jacobs and Kelley are two of the most prominent and respected schools on campus, it would make sense for there to be a combination of both to study here, but there’s not. IU is putting up new buildings pretty often, so they clearly have plenty of resources to do so. Currently the closest major relevant to take any music industry related classes is Arts Management in SPEA, but in order to take anything of possible use I have to also take non-profit oriented classes more geared towards arts non-profits. I know there are a lot of arts management majors who are in the same boat as me, so if there would be any proper degree in music business the BSAM program would see a huge drop off in numbers. So far, if I want to learn, gain experience, and make connections in the industry, I have to do it completely on my own.

I was wondering if I could get some advice/suggestion from y'all regarding it's tuition fee waiver or something similar. 
The program I am going for is M.S.Ed. Counseling and the tuition fee is $79,800 for 2 years ($1330 per credit hour). 
I have not applied for financial aid or any scholarships/fellowship as I am yet to receive the admit letter from IU. However, I have been asked to apply in advance and withdraw if not admitted so I'll be doing that today. 

I need help from you all in understanding: 
1. How much of a financial aid can I expect to receive or a direct tuition fee waiver Eg. Having to pay only in-state  tuition fee than out-state. 

2. Am I late for this? Should I have applied for financial aid earlier even before getting the interview call? 

3. How can I make sure that I survive in Bloomington with a tuition fee of 79,800 and manage my living cost?
 
4. Has anyone gotten any kind of a waiver or scholarship as an international student? Or maybe someone who knows an intl student (friend/acquaintance) whose got some financial relief? Pls let me know how did you/they get it &amp; when did you/they apply for it. 

5. I have Googled a lot regarding the management of living costs for intl students but I'd like to get some credible info from y'all.

$79,800 is a huge amount for me and I'd really appreciate some ideas to manage my finances.

tzcvhv,Undergraduate Solidarity with Grad Strike,"Graduate workers at IU are voting this Sunday to authorize a strike — no teaching, no grading, no office hours — because the IU administration has refused to open dialogue with the majority of grad workers who want a union in order to end mandatory fees, bargain for a living wage, and get better healthcare benefits. 

It is VERY likely the vote will go through (but we’ll post here to confirm).

So far, over 900 graduate workers have pledged to go on strike.

Many undergrads have asked how they can show solidarity with grad workers!

At noon on Wednesday the 13th, first day of the strike, there will be an UNDERGRAD STUDENT WALK-OUT! 

Many undergrads will be leaving their classes to go to the courtyard between Ballantine Hall and the Biology building, and march to the picket line. 

If you don’t have class at that time, join your peers in the courtyard!

There are other ways to show solidarity, too:

Join Coalition members on Monday 10am at Sample Gates to distribute  flyers for the strike and walk-out. 

Come to Canterbury House on Tuesday at 7pm to help make buttons and signs for the strike.

Sign the undergrad petition:

tzyfpw,I have to take the chemistry placement exam? - Orientation question,"incoming freshman here, and this is a bit surprising to me

I just signed up for the new student orientation and it says that I need to take a math placement exam (which I was expecting), but I also need to take a chemistry placement exam??? I really don't understand on what basis, as my intended major (finance) is not a science major, and I'm personally kinda not liking the fact that I have to give it, cuz I haven't done it since the 10th grade, and basically don't remember anything

wondering if anyone could explain why and if there was a way to not give it

I'm not a direct admit to kelley admit btw, I will be applying to kelley as a standard admit later (if this info is helpful)

thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/tzyfpw/i_have_to_take_the_chemistry_placement_exam/,latentluck,1,2022-04-09 13:51:02,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/tzyfpw/i_have_to_take_the_chemistry_placement_exam/

&gt; After fielding several requests, one faculty chair emailed a dire warning to members of his department: the university would reject any official requests to switch to online learning. And if professors attempted to switch unofficially, the state university system was prepared to track them down.

&gt; “I’ve been advised that physical audits (by USG auditors) may take place that check to see that... the class is meeting the day/time/classroom that is listed in the instructional plan,” the chair wrote in an email obtained by The Daily Beast on the condition that the author not be identified. USG refers to University System of Georgia, the governing body of the state’s 26 public universities.

&gt; Objections from students taking the classes, he said, would make no difference.

...

&gt; “We’re being treated like children who need to be monitored,” said Shira Chess, an associate professor of media studies at the University of Georgia. 

&gt; “Everyone keeps saying it’s important for students to be on campus, but most of the students I teach don’t want to be on campus,” she told The Daily Beast. “And some faculty feel like they’re being bullied to teach in person.”

&gt; While versions of this rebuff [of graduate student demands] have been sounded numerous times, this year at Indiana University, Bloomington, things have changed in two ways.

&gt; First, the long-term President and Provost—both of whom, in different ways, had ascended from the ranks of the faculty—were replaced by a new President and Provost from the outside (the new President, who hired the new Provost, was herself hired under very shady circumstances, and when these serious procedural irregularities were discovered through the investigative [reporting](https://medium.com/@stevesan/you-have-no-idea-how-strange-this-process-has-been-the-difficult-search-for-iu-s-19th-president-f61b473014d4) of a tenured Law Professor, this professor’s e-mail account was investigated and he was subjected to harassment; all of this has been covered in the national media, most notably at [the Chronicle; see here](https://www.chronicle.com/article/this-professor-investigated-a-presidential-search-at-his-university-it-said-he-was-out-of-line)). This new administration, which immediately ordered a retrenchment of IU’s COVID-19 policies, has proceeded in a generally imperious way in announcing new priorities that seem more focused on student recruitment and athletic boosterism than on education or faculty governance.

&gt; Second, the Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition, seeking affiliation with the United Electrical Workers, has received [signed union cards](https://www.indianagradworkers.org/strike-faq) from over 1750 graduate student workers, a supermajority of the relevant bargaining unit. 

&gt; As before, all efforts to organize a certification election or to negotiate with IU administration have met with [dismissal](https://www.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/education/campus/2022/02/11/indiana-university-union-election-iu-graduate-workers-coalition/6702666001/).

&gt; But unlike before, the Coalition recently declared that it intends to strike on April 13 unless its demands for recognition, including the simple recognition involved in a meeting, are met. There demands have not been met or even addressed. And so a strike vote has been taken, and passed by an overwhelming majority. And so a strike is set to begin in less than 48 hours.

&gt; A strike on the Indiana campus will be unprecedented. 

...

&gt; The striking graduate student workers at Indiana University are doing something all too rare on campuses and in our society: they are joining together to speak up for themselves, and refusing to back down in the face of corporate condescension and bullying. They are displaying real backbone and real moral seriousness, and everyone on the IU campus and beyond can learn from their example.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/u3fcv5/classrooms_and_class_struggle_at_indiana/,saryl,1,2022-04-14 07:31:14,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/u3fcv5/classrooms_and_class_struggle_at_indiana/

u3idmg,Information about Read Hall for incoming freshmen,"Hello! I wanted to give some information on Spruce and Read for new freshmen coming in next year. For background, I lived at Read, in a double, and then moved into a single in spruce due to issues with my roommate. 

First of all, I’ll start with the overall building. Read is probably the nicest building i've seen on campus in terms of their lobby, it’s very well kept and looks pretty nice. As far as the people go, Read has a lot of music students, so there are a lot of more quirky people there, which I liked a lot. The front desk staff at Read are also some of the nicest people I’ve met on campus, along with the RAs. 

There’s a cafe in Read, however most stuff is constantly sold out and you have to order it off grubhub. I believe it used to be a normal dining hall, but now it’s just a cafe, unlike somewhere like Wright or Forest. But, Forest dining hall is pretty close, on the same street, so it’s almost like you have a dining hall in Read anyways. Read cafe has some grab n go food though, like sushi (highly recommend the veggie sushi it’s actually so good), bagels, salads, and other snacks. I believe they used to have a waffle place in Read open previously, that was open until midnight, but we didn’t have it in the 2020-2021 school year, I’m not sure if they’ll bring it back in the future. 

They have really fun events in Read. Some that stook out were like karaoke nights in the Hoosier Den and multiple painting parties! The Hoosier Den also allows you to rent out board games to play with your friends. And, the Hoosier Den is a great place to study, it’s usually quiet but still has some people in it so it doesn’t feel like you’re studying by yourself. A lot of the times I saw people studying there while the RAs would put Lo-Fi Girl on the projector, so pretty good vibes. 

Read is separated into 5 sections, Curry, Landes, Clark, Beck, and Core. And each hall is split up into genders, while core is co-ed. I personally lived in core, the core rooms aren’t in a hallway like the other sections, they’re rather rooms around lounges, kind of. An important thing to note is core can use their crimson cards to access any door or elevator. For example, if you live in Beck, you HAVE to use the Beck entrance and elevator. For example, If you live in core you’re able to use the Curry entrance to get into the building, and the Landes elevator to get to your floor. You can also enter any hallway with a core room, other sections aren't able to enter halls other than their own. They call Wright “Virgin Vault” for seperating genders a lot, but I’d say Read is similar if not worse if you care about that. 

Onto the rooms, which is what I think most people are looking for information on. As said, I lived in a double, in core. My room has a full bath, shared by 2 rooms (4 people), only some of the rooms in Read have a full bath, which are about half the core rooms and RA rooms. The one’s with full baths are considered to be “enhanced rooms”. So, it kind of is confusing bc you think you’re in standard, but it ends up being enhanced and you kind of have to pay for something you didn’t ask for if you get placed in one of these rooms, but hey you have a shower which is totally worth it. All rooms in Read have a half bath though. This may sound weird but the half baths have no type of hallway room, like mine did, it's just like a door on each side, and you can like hear when people pee very loud, so I feel like shitting in one of those bathrooms would be awkward, maybe that’s just me though. So expect to be able to use your bathroom in your room, and then have to go to a communal restroom to use the shower. Don’t worry though the bathrooms and showers are very nice and pretty private. The only thing is if you’re in core without a shower, you have to walk all the way through the core and down another hallway to get to the showers.

In terms of temperature, in Read my room was Always SO HOT. Like it got barably hot even though we were paying for AC. We frequently had to have maintenance come check out our AC to see if it was working. You also aren’t able to change the temperature in your room yourself, unfortunately. Similarly, you can’t open your windows, unless you’re on the first floor I believe. In terms of size, The rooms are generally pretty mid-size in Read, but some in core are absolutely huge. Also, a lot of rooms in Read facing Jacob’s school have really pretty views. The girls in the hall next to me, which I shared an RA with were ALWAYS complaining about every little noise in the group chat, but I never noticed much. But, even people in spruce know Read as the noisy dorm I guess. 

Anyways, if you have any questions about Read feel free to ask.

u548o1,How Graduate Research Assistantship works?,"Hello,

I work as a research project coordinator at School of Public Health. My salary comes from several research grants. I am a full time employee so I get all the fringe benefits (401K, Health Insurance, Tuition subsidy) and I have been thinking of pursuing a master's degree since the research grant will be exhausted eventually and the research will get done.

I saw one policy about research assistantship is that if I am 50% of FTE, they will pay 30 credits of tuition remission per academic year, minimum $15,000 stipend for 10 months, and will cover my health plan. The faculty is willing to hire me as a research assistant. The problem is, my first preferred degree program is on a different school. The 2nd preferred degree program is in the School of Public Health but it's offered by a different department than the one my faculty is in. 

I did send one email to someone who is responsible for admission and enrollment but mentioned about talking to the director of the department where I work and the director of the department where the program is being offered and then discuss with them to figure out if that's possible. 

Before I discuss about my situation with the directors of the departments, I want to know if there is any specific policy that states that research assistants have to take courses from the same department where he/she works. How much autonomy the research assistants have regarding which degree/courses to take? Also the autonomy of a faculty regarding hiring graduate assistant if the salary is coming from the faculty's research grant. Is it actually the faculty who hires the research assistant or is it the university that hires research assistant and the assigns which faculty the assistant will work with?

This talking points will help me have a persuasive discussion with the directors and decide what I need to do next.

u57xih,Information on Spruce Hall for Incoming Freshman [SINGLES],"Hello! I wanted to give some information on Spruce and Read for new freshmen coming in next year. For background, I lived at Read, in a double, and then moved into a single in spruce due to issues with my roommate. 

There’s less to cover with spruce, since it doesn’t have all the amenities that somewhere like Read has, also I believe it’s one of the smallest if not the smallest dorm at IU. As a building Spruce is VERY nice. Probably the best dorm I've come across in terms of aesthetics. It’s also very clean and upkept. There’s a really pretty lobby at spruce that’s usually pretty quiet, great for studying. They also have a pool room as well. Compared to Read, the lobby is however very small, but i’d say it’s cozier and feels cleaner. The only downside is the fact that 

Spruce doesn’t have a dining hall or cafe in the building itself, however the dining hall at Forest is right across the street and Read cafe is like a 3 minute walk down the street, so don’t be too worried about having to walk miles for all your meals. Also, the wilkie c store is also right across the street out the backdoor, so that is very convenient. 

I’ve noticed less events at Spruce, but due to the smaller size it feels more tight knit, the group chats seem to be more active than the one at Read. But, there’s not as many events compared to Read. But, I think you could probably still go to the events at Read. No one’s gonna ask if you live there if you go. However, the Spruce RAs still try to do fun things and mine has done some fun stuff for us, like getting us Pizza, gift baskets, etc. 

The room set up is less complicated than Read, there’s just a north and south side, the south side facing Wilkie and/or 3rd street, and the north side facing Read. At Read everyone kept their door shut and it was less social, but spruce seems to be more social within the floors. The elevators also work much faster than Read’s do for some reason. And, laundry does cost a penny, but you’re able to charge it onto your crimson card and use your ibucks for laundry.

I can’t give information on the normal double room in Spruce, but I can give information on the single suites. First off, I just wanna say I really suggest living in a single if you have any apprehension about living with a roommate. People go into it thinking they'll make more friends in a double, but usually your roommate isn’t going to be your best friend or anything. If you stay up late, get a single. If you wake up late/early, get a single. If you’re messy or like your room super clean, get a single. If you like your alone time, get a single. If you plan on being in your room a lot, get a single. I just like it so much more. The singles in Spruce are set up where you walk into a room with a sink with three doors, two leading to singles, and one to a bathroom. You have your own shower in the single suites! It’s super nice with a glass door. Then the singles are a pretty good size. I can live comfortably in the space, I don't feel like I don't have room for my stuff. If you think about it, you actually get more space in a single than a double in general, since you aren’t sharing it, and it’s not too much smaller than a double. I’d say my single at spruce is 3/4ths the size of my double room in Read. You can also adjust your thermostat in Spruce! And, I’ve never had a day where it was unbearably hot nor unbearably cold. I do believe most doubles in Spruce have a bathroom with a shower that 2 rooms will share, but don’t quote me. That means you would share a bathroom with 4 people in a double, and 2 people in a single. 

Hope this helps! Hope you enjoy your time at IU more than I have lmao, I'm getting ready to transfer schools, but I still had an alright experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/u57xih/information_on_spruce_hall_for_incoming_freshman/,hatsuneemikuu,1,2022-04-16 17:41:34,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/u57xih/information_on_spruce_hall_for_incoming_freshman/

u85qsx,Struggling to get an internship? Here’s what you need to know.,"**I’m a recent grad but I remember how hard it was to get my first few internships.** For my first one, I actually didn’t get one until 2 weeks before the start date. So there’s hope! You still have time to get a good job (mine was at TD).

**If you wanna maximize your chances, here’s what you can do:**

* Lower your standards, apply to most jobs. Getting any internship is better than none.
* Apply on other job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, AngelList, Handshake, Levels.fyi etc.).
* Return to a previous internship if you can.

**If you’re barely getting any interviews, improve your resume**. Here’s how:

* RESULTS are THE most important part of your resume. It should be in at least 80% of your bullet points. Try to estimate what impact you've had in your previous roles, such as hours and money saved.
* Don't forget your hobbies and interests! It’s highly important that you connect on a personal level with the hiring manager. Adding your interests allows them to bring up similarities so you can easily connect.
* Make it easy to scan! Employers only take 10-30 sec to read your resume. If they struggle to scan it quickly, that’s an excuse for them to not read it. Add a lot of white space, bold important things, and organize it well.
* Get your resume critiqued by A LOT of friends, student clubs, and most importantly, professionals since they’re the ones who screen resumes.

**Write cover letters! Yeah I hate them too, but they work.**

* Tailor your cover letter as much as possible! Read the job description well and note the 3 most important skills that they want. Then, write about how you match your skills through stories of your experiences. It’s that simple!
* Make sure you’re writing well! Good writing shows you’re a clear thinker, good at communicating, and you pay attention to detail.

**If you get interviews but no offers, here’s how to interview better:**

* Be likeable - You're not getting hired by a company, you're getting hired by a person who will have to work with you everyday. To hire you, they must like you more than the other candidates. So be pleasant, smile, joke around, and be authentic!
* Be unique and show your personality. If you're like everyone else, you're competing directly with them. If you bring something new to the table (hobbies, skills, personality, etc.), you're incomparable. They can't say you're better or worse cause you're different. So get wild with it. Tell them about your weird childhood story, your random interests, and what made you who you are. Be different.
* PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE! Do LOTS of mock interviews with friends and any professionals you may know.

**Good luck, you got this!! Happy to answer any questions in the comments.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/u85qsx/struggling_to_get_an_internship_heres_what_you/,uat2,1,2022-04-20 16:30:39,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/u85qsx/struggling_to_get_an_internship_heres_what_you/

ua6esz,Kelley's undergrad rigor and college life,"Hi, I am an incoming undergrad at Kelley with Marketing as the intended major. (International Student from India)

I want to ask a few questions about Kelley.

Firstly, what is the level of academic rigor for an incoming freshman and how many hours a day does n undergrad has to dedicate to academics to maintain a decent academic profile. How much free time is leftover apart from academics for self-exploration and entrepreneurial pursuit.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, how is the vibe at IUB with respect to peer group and teacher-student interaction and how good is it as compared to Smeal B-school at Penn State (UP).

&amp;#x200B;

My aim is not to secure a job after undergrad but to build out real problem-solving business with my undergrad itself, so how supportive is the environment at Kelley for this especially as compared to other top B-schools.

I am from India and I have applied and got admits from the following universities for MS in CS program:

1. Rochester Institute of Technology (MSCS): According to me the co-op is an advantage here but high tuition and living expenses is making me sweat.

2. Indiana University Bloomington (MSCS): The curriculum is great but location wise i felt that it's a little isolated. The living expenses are relatively cheap. I want to know if it's difficult to find internships/jobs/opportunities here (although at the end of the day everyone has to find jobs of the portals like LinkedIn)

3. Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago(MSCS):  I have been offered a 12000 USD SCHOLARSHIP on tuition thus making it a not so expensive option (There isn’t much difference between cost here and in indiana since this will be a 1.5 years degree). The curriculum is good as well. The advantage here I feel is the location plus two of my close friends have finalized this (I know peer group shouldn’t be a parameter to consider for masters but I’ve never lived away from my home so this adds a little comforting factor)


I need inputs regarding the following points

1. On campus jobs availability (to cover at least living expenses

udul49,I can’t believe my faculty colleagues,"They keep pushing the grad pay issue off to the administration hoping the grads will force them to find the money for raises. The other day the grads were asking ""where does the tuition money go for the students I teach?"" Most were surprised to learn that it goes to their department, not the provost. IU's financial structure is something called Responsibility Centered Management or RCM. So if you make money (by something like teaching students) you get that money. (Things you learn on department budget committees.) Then a portion of it goes to the administration for things like cutting the grass, providing the classroom and offices, technology, etc. So departments have control of their grad stipends, not the university. Hence the wide variety in grad pay and benefits. You notice grads from certain departments/schools aren't out there on the picket lines or are keeping their mouth shut about their benefits - travel, meal plans,12-month contracts, research stipends, some even get housing!) Some departments stepped up years ago so they could compete with other institutions for top grad candidates. Now those that haven't are causing all these problems and expecting the administration to rescue them. In the end, the provost will dictate what the grads get paid and departments will have to find the money anyway. Then hey will complain that some departments pay too much! This happened to me in grad school! Half the grads gained and half the grads lost. Faculty need to step up and go to their department budget meetings and decide if they really need catered lunch at the department retreat and if a tenured professor jones really needs a third office in the department as an occasional adjunct, etc. How many of the faculty out there shouting their support are willing to give up a little money from their six-figure research budget to pay for ""the assistance that is so critical to their research."" Find the money people! Two disclaimers here: 1) I've talked to a number of faculty and administrators who admitted they had never been to a budget meeting and didn't know what RCM is or how it worked until this happened. So this is really something that should be in new faculty orientation. 2) I'm not tenured. And if the grads get what they want they will go from $28 an hour to $37 an hour - they will make more than me!

uepp32,IU appoints new vice president dedicated to student success,"https://news.iu.edu/stories/2022/04/iu/releases/29-vice-president-student-success.html


&gt; A nationally recognized leader in student affairs is joining Indiana University in an inaugural leadership role dedicated to student success and well-being. IU President Pamela Whitten has appointed **Julie Payne-Kirchmeier** to the role of vice president for student success starting Aug. 1, pending approval of the Board of Trustees.

...

&gt; Currently vice president for student affairs at Northwestern University, Payne-Kirchmeier oversees divisions that include housing, dining, counseling, health services, campus life, fraternity and sorority life, campus inclusion, and technology.

&gt; Before joining Northwestern University in 2012, Payne-Kirchmeier was the assistant provost for the University College at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. She has also held student-focused positions at the University of Southern Indiana. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Texas A&amp;M University-College Station, and her Ph.D. in educational leadership, administrations and foundations at Indiana State University.

**Senior administrators emphasize NU’s demonstration policy following student protest**

https://dailynorthwestern.com/2021/11/10/campus/senior-administrators-emphasize-nus-demonstration-policy-following-student-protest/

&gt; Following a student [protest](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2021/11/06/sports/football/football-student-activists-protest-on-the-field-at-saturdays-game/) at the Nov. 6 Northwestern-Iowa football game, senior administrators reiterated NU’s [demonstration policy](https://policies.northwestern.edu/docs/demonstration-policy-final.pdf) in a universitywide email Tuesday, emphasizing the University will take action to hold demonstrators accountable for violating the policy.

&gt; The email said the University protects students’ freedom of speech but will enforce repercussions for students who violate the demonstration policy. Ramifications may involve “suspension, expulsion or legal consequences as appropriate,” the email said.

...

&gt; At the protest, [students holding banners ran onto Ryan Field](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2021/11/06/sports/football/football-student-activists-protest-on-the-field-at-saturdays-game/) during the game and stood for around three minutes before they were escorted off the field. Some spectators yelled slurs and threw objects in the direction of the protestors, and one Iowa fan ran onto the field and attempted to grab the students’ banners, pulling one protester to the ground.

...

&gt; The universitywide Tuesday email — which was signed by Schapiro, Provost Kathleen Hagerty, Executive Vice President Craig Johnson and Vice President for Student Affairs **Julie Payne-Kirchmeier** — also comes in the days [that follow anti-Indigenous vandalism at The Rock](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2021/11/09/campus/naisa-reflects-on-anti-indigenous-hate-on-campus-after-rock-painting-vandalized/). The University addressed the vandalism [in a statement published in Leadership Notes](https://www.northwestern.edu/leadership-notes/2021/responding-to-anti-indigenous-speech-at-the-rock.html) but did not issue a university-wide email.

**Football: Student activists protest on the field at Saturday’s game**

https://dailynorthwestern.com/2021/11/06/sports/football/football-student-activists-protest-on-the-field-at-saturdays-game/

&gt; The protesters were members of multiple student activist groups, including NU Community Not Cops, Students for Justice in Palestine, NU Dissenters, Fossil Free NU and Students Organizing for Labor Rights. The students stood for just over three minutes before being escorted off the field. The banners they held read, “Board of Trustees meet with us now,” “Abolish NUPD invest in Black lives” and “Stop funding the war on Palestine,” among other messages.

...

&gt; In light of recent allegations of druggings at fraternity houses and other nearby residencies, the protesters also stood in solidarity with survivors of sexual assault on campus. In their demands, they urged the University to build better protections for and systems that center and support survivors of sexual violence.

**Northwestern student activists, administrators debate demonstration policy**

https://dailynorthwestern.com/2021/11/29/campus/northwestern-student-activists-administrators-debate-demonstration-policy/

&gt; (Julie Payne-Kirchmeier) sent us an email after the Iowa-Northwestern football game saying that Northwestern is supporting freedom of dissent, supporting people to demonstrate peacefully and all these tenants that they claim to uphold,” the student said. “The University does not have a history of that.”

...

&gt; After protests against former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in fall 2019, five NU students received citations for “disorderly conduct and interfering with the duties of a police officer.” Students underwent a University accountability process, and charges from the city were later dismissed in Evanston court. 

&gt; Now, some student activists are calling for institutional changes to how the University responds to demonstrations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/uepp32/iu_appoints_new_vice_president_dedicated_to/,saryl,1,2022-04-29 12:26:44,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/uepp32/iu_appoints_new_vice_president_dedicated_to/

I-Core: 13 credit hours

uf5xrc,I need 2 weeks long sublet,"Hi guys. First of all, sorry for this post about housing. I already looked through all websites and pages online, I couldn't solve my housing problem. I need you guys' help!

I need a two-week long sublet in August but lots of sublets I found are for the summer vacation (like May to July or early August). The move-in date for my place is 27th in August so I have to find a place to stay at least for 2 weeks before I move in my apartment. 

I already checked out Fb, air bnb lists and a bunch of other listings but none. Even if there is, the price is crazy (like $150 per night which I cannot afford or way way too far from the campus). Me and my roommmate can split the cost but still outrageous. 

I also checked whether the school provides guest housing but unfortunately it no longer runs this service. Is there any way to sublet an affordable place at least for 2 weeks (around 13th-28th in August)?

My first apartment here was pretty solid, the couch had leather come off from just regularly sitting on it but it was OK outside of that. However, since moving out of that apartment I've had a pretty bad experience here. I had to pay $200 for the couch (which fell apart entirely just from me using it regularly, my roommate never touched it and we don't have pets). My washer didn't work for several months after moving in, we had to continually bother the staff to get a working washer after about 3 months of living here. I also had yellow jackets come in through my vents and bother me and my roommates, despite talking to the office about this they didn't stop coming until it got too cold out which was weeks later. For the last couple weeks my AC has been broken and despite sending in a request for maintenance weeks ago and my roommates and I discussing it with the office staff several times it's still not fixed.

In this regard, we have a few questions for current or past premed students at IU. We would appreciate your time and help.

1. How hard is to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.9+ ? How is the grade distribution, I.e is there any curve or x percentage of students get A grade etc? Is premed + business major doable? Or do you recommend a science major. She is a bright student, currently has 4.0 unweighted and 4.75 weighted GPA.

2. How good are the opportunities to do research?

3. Any hospitals nearby to do volunteering and shadowing and how competitive to get one ?

4. Does Indiana university medical school take in a lot of students from their own university? Since we are OOS, will consider us favorably or give any preference for us?

5. Does IU award good merit scholarship for OOS kids?

uhjdut,EDITORIAL: ‘Shame on their lawyers’,"https://specials.idsnews.com/iu-records-public-access-violations-ferpa-title-ix-shame-on-their-lawyers-apra/index.html 

&gt; IU’s violations of public access laws this year show contempt for transparency. But the problem is even deeper.

...

&gt; IU’s motto is lux et veritas — light and truth. But as a public university, IU’s multiple violations of public access laws, delays and denials fly in the face of its motto’s commitment to transparency.

...

&gt; The Indiana Daily Student requests far more records from IU than any other single news outlet or company, according to IU’s own data. We request records to make our stories more fair, more factual, more nuanced and more interesting. We want to believe the university sees us as partners in the pursuit of light and truth.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite our newsroom’s best efforts, we can’t get any evidence that they engage with us in good faith. The anecdotal evidence we have points in the opposite direction.
&gt; 
&gt; At the IDS currently, there are several reporters waiting on records they requested months ago, some of which they have never heard back about other than automated responses saying the request was received. One recently filed a complaint with public access counselor Luke Britt, who has already determined IU violated public access laws multiple times this academic year.

...

&gt; On March 22, we requested to see responses to those [170 requests in the log related to sexual misconduct, disciplinary records and Title IX] so we could hand-code a column indicating when the requests were completed and to what extent the requested records were provided. We followed up several times between then and April 18, when [Amelia Marvel, assistant general counsel] called to discuss the request.
&gt; 
&gt; As of publication, over three months after the initial request for the log and a month after the narrowed request, none of those records had been provided.

...

&gt; While reporting [the “Dissonance in Due Process[Dissonance in Due Process](https://specials.idsnews.com/iu-jacobs-school-dissonance-in-due-process/)"" story],  IDS reporter Cate Charron requested Parker’s disciplinary records. Her request was denied. In denying Charron the records, IU argued it wasn’t obligated to determine whether a student code of conduct violation — sexual assault — falls under FERPA’s definition of a violent crime.
&gt; 
&gt; “That’s absolutely ludicrous,” [Mike Hiestand, senior legal counsel at the Student Press Law Center] said of that argument. “Shame on their lawyers.”
&gt; 
&gt; The public access counselor determined IU had violated APRA in denying Charron these records, calling the result “absurd.” IU still hasn’t released the records, or any records in connection with several other of Charron’s requests related to this story.

...

&gt; “Students who were themselves party to sexual assault complaints or had been the ones who filed complaints — they weren’t even giving those students access to their own records,” [Carley Lanich, IU alumna, former IDS staffer and current education reporter at the South Bend Tribune] said. “So why are they going to do that with a reporter?”
&gt; 
&gt; IU says it’s committed to complying with public access laws. Even putting this year’s violations aside, compliance with the letter of the law is not a robust commitment to transparency.

...

&gt; If it takes a month to get a document that isn’t what we requested, how can we trust the university to provide the records that matter to the rest of our stories?

...

&gt; We have been taught to expect this. We have put up with lengthy delays and offensive arguments from lawyers who should know better.
&gt; 
&gt; We opened this story with IU’s motto: light and truth. That’s because at the end of the day, we want to know why IU insists on keeping student journalists in the dark.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/uhjdut/editorial_shame_on_their_lawyers/,saryl,1,2022-05-03 12:03:22,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/uhjdut/editorial_shame_on_their_lawyers/

&amp;#x200B;

Incoming Kelley freshman here. I was just watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEIcnoALkY4&amp;ab_channel=Scott%26Eric) about Kelley freshman classes and the video creators (2 Kelley students) mentioned in the comments that Kelley would stop accepting Ivy Tech course transfers ""either this summer or next fall."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I previously have read on this subreddit that it would be beneficial for my GPA and quality of life if I took Finite math (Math-M-118) over the summer at Ivy Tech instead of in the fall at IU.

uimnxc,about to graduate with a BLS... now what,"So I'm FINALLY graduating (on-off student since 2011) but I switched majors completely after completing 3/4 a degree in EALC. The idea was to finish without having to completely start over with majors and just do Liberal Studies (it's like general studies) and work towards graduate programs in what I thought I wanted to study. 

Turns out, I'm almost 30, and I'm so fried with school at this point and just want to work and be independent. However, I have NO IDEA what, if anything, this degree qualifies me for.
Every advisor or person I asked gave me vague non-answers. So, here I am, applying at Menard's for a stocker job I could have had 15 years ago because, since I've decided not to apply for Grad school, I ended up with a nothin degree and no job ideas or leads. 

I was working as a personal trainer as well, but had to take leave for illness and had to be temporarily let go. Does anybody have any suggestions on how to go about finding a job that has pay reflective of my arduous efforts to be educated, or maybe ideas of connections I could make before I officially enter ""non-student, real working adult"" status?

TLDR;
-Graduating at 29 with a bachelor's in liberal studies

I was doing some research on Music Discovery, and I found that people's (Gen Z and Millenials) main complaint is that it takes too long to find new music you love.

This was the core insight that led me to develop a new way to recommend + shorten music/podcasts and I'd love to test it out now.

If you'd like I can email over a sample 1 minute playlist (just provide your favorite genre+1 song) using the shortening algorithm to test out.

ull390,RUSH,"It’s worth it.

It’s by far the best decision I’ve made at IU, especially in terms of academic, mental, and social wellbeing.

Being in a fraternity raises you to a higher standard of experience: how you carry yourself, the grades you need to participate, the physical and the mental shape you keep yourself in.

You also become a valuable player in a tight-knit community of guys who are always up to something. I haven’t been bored once since I joined up. There’s always somewhere to go, something to do, someone to study or chill with. I’m in a couple clubs at IU, and nothing measures up to the strength and depth of the bonds you form in a fraternity.

You’ll have so much fun during welcome week, but when the dust settles, you’re gonna want to keep partying. If you’re gonna party in college, do it right.

So I created a program to select the 'best' 10 second snippet and autoplays those music/podcast snippets in a Tik Tok-like feed. Kind of like a trailer for a movie.

If you'd like I can email over a sample 1 minute playlist (just provide your favorite genre) using the shortening algorithm to test out. I can send the app when we are about to launch.

Sign up for the waitlist below if you are interested and I'd love any comments/criticisms on designs :)

vbimzn,The Futurist Society," 

Hello everyone!

I've created a national student club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We discuss flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We are building a Wiki of many types of future tech as a resource for people looking to know more about technology. We also have plans to start doing projects as our organization gets more established. We also have guest talks from speakers who work in tech!

Right now there is no chapter being formed at this school, but we are always looking for people to help us start new ones for the next school year! Being one of our leaders could be a great opportunity in shaping your resume and in making connections! We also welcome anyone who just wants to join for our discussions.

We have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! If you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!

You can also visit our website below for more information.

vdqqht,Discover new songs on Spotify faster feedback 🎵 [class project],"Spotify Recommendations, TikTok songs, DJ sets, AUX road trips with friends and the classic, “Wow, what is that groovy song that’s playing in the cafe right now?” Often, we can easily tell whether we like a song by listening to just a short snippet of it.

So for class, My friends and I built an add-on to Spotify that takes a song and shortens it to the ""best"" 10 seconds to help you find your next favorite song and go through your Discover Weekly or Release Radar, faster.

It learns what the ""best"" X second snippets are to you as you listen more. Uses genre/class/valence/song/weather/chorus/bridge and other factors.

Recommends new music in 10-20-second snippets to help you discover new music faster in a Tik Tok-like feed. Would love criticism :)

vj50s9,Spanish at IU,"Hello,

I am incoming IU freshman and I am curious about the Spanish curriculum at IU. 

I took AP-""equivalent""  Spanish my senior year of high school but did not take the exam. 

I want to expand my Spanish knowledge, but at the same time I want to get into the Hutton Honors College, which requires a fall GPA of 3.8+. Spanish was one of my hardest classes in high school (I got mostly B's), and I am afraid that I will also get a B (or worse) in Spanish 250 (HISP-S 250) if I place into that. I also recognize that a college Spanish class will most likely be full of people who are more experienced and motivated with respect to the language. 

In addition, I read [this HISP-S 250 syllabus](https://mbpollock.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/2018.1-s250-syllabus.pdf), and the class seemed really intense.

So, can anyone speak to the difficulty of HISP-S 200 and 250 at IU? Is it an uphill battle to get good grades at these higher levels (maybe I should try to place into lower levels), or is it more accommodating?

w9u5gj,Vector Marketing Is a Scam,"Received a letter in the mail from Vector Marketing about an 'excellent student job opportunity' and getting this garbage in the mail after previously being approached by two VM recruiters on LinkedIn (a Paige Weber and a Mason Willix) who also targeted other IU students triggered me to make this PSA. 

Vector Marketing is a scam. It's an MLM that preys on unknowing students and assigns them the sales 'job' of endlessly berating family/friends/anyone into buying knives they don't need. You get roped into an 'interview' where: you don't get to ask any questions, they describe to you how YOU have to buy the inventory that you're then expected to sell, and then they advise you to start selling to friends and family first. Then you fill out a form recommending other people for the job.

This is the most obvious scam in the world, and yet they continue to aggressively operate. Especially with the new freshmen class coming in, I thought it'd be a good reminder to everyone to stay away from VM. If you get a letter in the mail with 'Vector Marketing' or 'Cutco' (the Knives brand this pyramid scheme sells), rip it up and throw it away. If you get a LinkedIn DM from Paige Weber, or Mason Willix, or any other recruiter, block them on and move on; for Christ's sake don't accept/respond to their message, and definitely don't connect with them (like some people I know have). 

If you're looking for a job/professional experience, HandShake, AngelList, and consulting an IU Career Coach or talking with upperclassmen are all great places to start. Likewise you can always just find a job at some local business in town or on campus. Anything's better than the red flag that is VM.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/w9u5gj/vector_marketing_is_a_scam/,unexplored_worlds,1,2022-07-27 19:58:10,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/w9u5gj/vector_marketing_is_a_scam/

wjtz5b,Obtaining EM-P &amp; SV pass?,"I’m an undergraduate student but I also work in a managerial role for a large department at IUB. Under [directory.iu.edu](directory.iu.edu) and in the Payroll system, I’m listed as “Regular Hourly” instead of the typical “Student, Temporary Employee”

Due to this, I’m required to use my personal vehicle to transport large quantities of work materials/items to/from temporary work sites. Additionally, I’m required to have access to my vehicle and serve as mobile first aid/risk management, while other professionals arrive. From my understanding, this qualifies for an SV parking pass. However, an SV pass requires an accompanying EM-S/P pass. All of the FT Salaried employees are given a EM-P &amp; SV pass, paid for by the department. 

When I tried to obtain an EM-P pass, I was told that’s prohibited because of my undergraduate student status. 

What am I supposed to do? The closest ST parking area to some of my temporary work sites are ~10 minute walk. That doesn’t factor in carrying work items back/forth. Additionally, I wouldn’t be able to respond to emergencies for incident management. 

My department has been …less than supportive… and has told me, they will not purchase the passes through the department. If I want the passes, I have to obtain/pay for them myself. (Which is fine, I’m not worried abt the financial aspect).

wmy5d5,"IU postponing technology and equipment lifecycle upgrades until FY24, limiting non-essential business travel, and reducing spending on events","Dear IU Bloomington Faculty, Staff, and Student Academic Appointees,

Following last week’s announcement of initial action from the university regarding elements of the Task Force recommendations, I write to you in this message to share additional context and updates on further steps we intend to take.

First, as I shared in a message last week, we are thrilled we are able to take much-needed and timely action to increase stipends for our SAAs, and that our benchmarking process will ensure compensation continues to keep pace with the top half of the BIG Ten in the years to come. I’m particularly grateful to the members of the Task Force working group on financial support for their thoughtful recommendations. 

In the years ahead, we will work closely with our deans to conduct careful budget planning that integrates the costs for these improved stipends within program and college budgets. For the current year, we will make an array of temporary adjustments that will allow us to invest roughly $12.5 million in additional SAA stipends, without introducing significant delays to other key priorities for our campus. 

One part of these costs has already been built into FY23 budgets. The remainder will be achieved through postponing technology and equipment lifecycle upgrades until FY24, limiting non-essential business travel, and reducing spending on events paid for using general funds. I know these efforts will not be without difficulty or inconvenience for our faculty and staff, but I’m appreciative of your understanding and support as we prioritize our investments in graduate education. 

Second, I have charged David Daleke, Interim Dean of the IUB Graduate School and Vice Provost for Graduate Education, with developing a campus-wide protocol for implementing recommendations from the Task Force to ensure financial transparency for graduate students as they consider attending IU. 

As the Task Force outlined, prospective graduate students deserve full information about their SAA position, stipend and other support amounts, years of support, tuition and fee remission, and health insurance. Similarly, based on the protocol to be developed under David’s leadership, departments will also ensure that students have up-to-date information about the average time to degree, credit hours required to complete their degree, and the number of years the financial support package is designed to support.

Our students have a reasonable expectation of clarity, and this process will ensure that all students, regardless of discipline or college, can make fully-informed decisions about their academic future at IU.

Finally, as the Task Force continues to make progress, I am pleased to report that the Working Group on Health and Wellness met for the first time last week to establish its objectives and discuss the scope of its focus. The Working Group on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion will meet in the coming weeks to begin its work as well. I look forward to receiving additional recommendations from the Task Force, leading to further opportunities for substantive action to support students.

In the weeks ahead, the return to a regular schedule of shared governance activities, including through the Bloomington Faculty Council and its newly reconstituted SAA Affairs Committee, will also allow us to explore additional action on issues impacting SAAs.

I remain grateful to so many across campus for their engagement on behalf of our graduate students, and I am excited to welcome both our students and our faculty back to campus in just a few short days. 

Sincerely,
 
Rahul Shrivastav

Provost

wo9vl1,Study Abroad Credits,"I’m planning on studying abroad in Spring 2023, have been accepted to one program already (ASPIRE), and am currently in the process of applying for one more (Madrid-IES). Studying abroad is a requirement for my major (International Studies), and these were the two programs I was most interested in/feel that I will personally benefit from participating in the most.

My problem is, part of the application process for Madrid involves creating a tentative schedule for abroad based on your remaining degree requirements and the courses abroad that would help fulfill these requirements. I’m worried that it will hurt my chances of being accepted to the program since I have almost no degree requirements left that would be fulfilled by classes abroad (my Gen-Ed’s are already done and my major classes are quite specific). I do have a Spanish minor, which is part of what made the Madrid program so appealing, but by the end of the Fall semester I will have completed all of those requirements as well. Would it be worth switching that minor to another major in order to have classes abroad that would be applicable in fulfilling my course equivalency/credits? I have not discussed this idea with my advisor yet, but I’m pretty confident that I would still have the time in my schedule to complete this.

The ASPIRE program that I have already been accepted to did not have this as a part of the application process, so I don’t know how much weight they put into that portion of the application/if it will significantly affect my chances of being accepted or denied for Madrid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/wo9vl1/study_abroad_credits/,selodus,1,2022-08-14 12:06:35,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/wo9vl1/study_abroad_credits/

woyy8j,Tips for Introverted Freshies…,"I know the struggling of coming to IU as a freshman and also being extremely introverted, so I thought I would share some tips/advice.

Roommates 
-your roommates may be very outgoing and want to go to parties; it’s okay to say no and stay in! And if they are being extremely rude about it, go to your RA.
-there will be drunk/not-sober people in your floor at some point. Most folks can take care of themselves until they wake up the next morning. However if it’s a situation where you feel the need to step in, you can always ask an RA for help (that’s not snitching, it’s helping a peer out and making sure they aren’t in danger). However, just because you stayed in does not mean you are automatically the designated care person or the designated driver. Once is a coincidence, twice is a pattern. Others should be responsible to have a designated driver/care taker, and not be taking advantage of your soberness. 

Buses
-always go to the back of the bus! Seriously there is nothing more annoying that folks not moving to the back of the bus. 
-each bus route has stops along campus -use the Double Map app to track buses and see where the stops are at. 
-you pull the string when the bus is approaching the stop to you want to get off at so that the driver knows the stop. If there is no one waiting at the stop, the driver won’t stop unless you pull said string. 
-say thank you to the bus drivers 

Study
-as an introvert, I’m guessing you have anxiety about making friends. I found that class study groups were my go to for finding people. Typically if they were in a study group, they were also somewhat introverted and dedicated to their studies. 
Plus a study group is much less chaotic that the party scene. 
-The IMU has thousands of hidden places to study at, explore and find a place for you. It’s the best place to be around people but not be bothered by people. 

Extra curriculars 
-this is referring to clubs and organizations 
-I got over my fear of going to new clubs once I started going to thing where I knew that I knew people who were going to be there. 
-I made a lot of friends through internships, and honestly they are both great friends and great professionals to network with

wrk50k,Bursar Loan Question,"howdy, 

I was lucky to receive a good amount of scholarships, and prior to those being applied to my bursar bill I was offered about $10K in student loans, which I accepted before.

However, because of my scholarships, my bursar bill was lower and I am only showing $4K in student loans being applied to my account.

wrnxer,Here's why I don't support the convention center expansion project. Change my mind.,"1. I think we should use local money to make Bloomington nice for the people who live here, not visitors. I get it, the desire for outside visitors to buy/consume things at high rates fuels the local economy and this seems like a win-win, but the ""investment"" comes at a cost for those who live here. And Bloomington, to me, doesn't seem to be struggling to attract people downtown, Bloomington-ness and the university do that. We're struggling to fund public transit (and no, the local income tax still isn't enough), to house the unhoused, to walk and bike safely, to provide housing diversity (yes, multiplexes), and the list goes on. 
2. There are usually numerous bad urban design outcomes. They're large one-purpose buildings that don't encourage visitors to get out and explore the town because everything is available within the building. So, they're coming to Bloomington, yes, but really they're coming to the Bloomington Convention Center and never leaving. I've been to many conferences and the setup has been that I've barely left the building to see the town. Everything is provided for you on-site - housing, food, socializing. It's honestly an empty experience. 
3. Cities are competing against each other for fewer conventions and fewer people. 

What if instead, we use the $14M of the food and beverage tax collected thus far for:

1. Invest in small businesses and artists (esp. BIPOC), and long-vacant buildings. 
2. Use the land to build housing or *literally anything else* (except a parking garage)
3. Create local pride via these new business/cool people that are creating a sense of place and making Bloomington, Bloomington.
4. Create a Bloomington where happy residents want to be who then in turn create cool things, and, are ya ready for it? - **ATTRACT TOURISM!

wwoym1,IU to Purdue and O'Hare,"Many people ask me for rides to O'Hare (ORD) and Purdue.  I wanted to post this to group source the best ways to get there on a budget.  Ideas:

1) Take a Greyhound from the Bloomington Transit Center to West Lafayette for Purdue, or Chicago Amtrak (and train from the station to ORD) [https://www.greyhound.com/en/ecommerce/schedule](https://www.greyhound.com/en/ecommerce/schedule)  This is also an inexpensive way to get to many other places.

2) Take the Go Express to Indianapolis Airport (IND)  [https://goexpresstravel.com/bloomington-airport-shuttle/](https://goexpresstravel.com/bloomington-airport-shuttle/)  From the transportation center at IND, take the Lafayette Limo to O'Hare (ORD) [https://www.lafayettelimo.com/index.php/services/90-shuttle-services](https://www.lafayettelimo.com/index.php/services/90-shuttle-services)  One can take that to Purdue, or the Lafayette Limo office in West Lafayette, and then book the Lafayette Limo to O'Hare.

3)  Take the Go Express to the transportation center at IND and then book an Uber/Lyft (picks up right at the IND Transportation Center) -- the Uber/Lyft rates out of IND are much less expensive than those from Bloomington.

4)  Take a Zipcar [https://www.zipcar.com/universities/indiana-university](https://www.zipcar.com/universities/indiana-university) or rent a car.

5)  Last resort, or if you have a lot of people, lot of luggage, need to get there ASAP, and don't care about the cost  -- DM me or make arrangements with another driver you know and trust, or book Uber/Lyft

Hi everyone!

We are a duo of 2020 alumni from Big Ten schools and are excited to share that [Aries Tickets](https://ariestickets.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=september2022&amp;utm_content=indiana_subreddit_post) has returned to Indiana after a successful pilot launch. Last year, over 1000 students joined, safely exchanging over 400 tickets. We learned a lot and really appreciate all the support.

[Aries Tickets](https://ariestickets.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=september2022&amp;utm_content=indiana_subreddit_post) is a platform for students to easily buy and sell tickets to sports.

Using the platform:

&amp;#x200B;

* **The platform is accessible to all students** by any browser or device. Being in the form of a website, there is no need to figure out which Facebook group or GroupMe chat to join.

x1wh77,"Email reminder from IU admin that ""Indiana University must adhere to certain rules that preclude the university from engaging in or appearing to engage in certain political activities""","From IU's Vice President Government Relations and Economic Engagement and IU's Vice President and General Counsel

&gt; Dear IU Community Members, 
&gt; 
&gt; As a public university with a tax-exempt status from the IRS, Indiana University must adhere to certain rules that preclude the university from engaging in or appearing to engage in certain political activities. To help ensure compliance with this requirement, while also protecting the free speech rights of individuals, Indiana University has established the GR-01 policy (Contact with State Officials, Federal Officials, and Political Campaigns, and Other Political Activities) and the UA-14 policy (The First Amendment at Indiana University). The purpose of these policies is to assist members of the IU community in navigating issues of political speech and activism in a manner that ensures personal political actions do not cause the university to violate relevant laws related to campaign finance and lobbying or the U.S. Tax Code. Such violations would threaten the university’s public standing and potentially its tax-exempt status. For more information, you can also visit IU’s Free Speech website. 
&gt; 
&gt; As university leaders, we understand and acknowledge we are living in a charged political era. As a public university, we have a duty to improve the lives and well-being of Hoosiers across the state, including by elevating civic participation and dialogue. Therefore, we applaud members of the IU community engaging in matters of public discourse. Indiana University is made up of extraordinarily passionate and talented individuals offering impactful scholarship, research, and insight into the pressing issues of our time. As we enter a new political campaign season and prepare for the next sessions of Congress and the Indiana General Assembly, it is important that all of us continue to be engaged citizens, but we must do so in a manner that adheres to the rules governing such actions within the university setting. 
&gt; 
&gt; Neither GR-01 nor UA-14 is intended to limit personal free speech or academic freedom. Rather, they are intended to provide parameters for distinguishing when speech and academic scholarship are put forth on behalf of the university and when they are put forth on an individual basis. Ultimately, these policies help protect the First Amendment rights of individuals within our community.
&gt; 
&gt; As such, university units and schools—just like the university as a whole—have an obligation to also follow these policies to help protect the First Amendment rights for their staff, faculty, and students. Political speech and activism by university units and schools may likely be viewed as restricting the rights of its members by creating a chilling effect on the speech of individuals that may have opposing viewpoints. 
&gt; 
&gt; We hope this letter and the referenced policies can assist you in navigating these important matters. If you need more detailed assistance, Brad Boswell, IU’s Executive Director for State Relations, can help. He can be reached at bsboswel@iu.edu. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you very much for your cooperation.

x2e7tl,Switch from Gmail to Outlook,"So I spent my morning looking through the 47 pages of (mostly) negative reviews on One.iu about the Outlook Exchange client and the switch away from Gmail. I looked on here to see if there was any discussion and the last relevant post was from 3 months ago. 

I suppose now that we're in the 2nd week of school I'm wondering how people's opinions are? A lot of the reviews were from back in June and July during the switch. Does everyone still hate it and miss Gmail or are we learning to deal with outlook?

I'll put my two cents in: I don't like the switch, I tried to connect my IU email to an external client  (Mozilla Thunderbird) on my PC and it wasn't working. (It did work with Spark on MacOS after a few tries). Found out it uses a different protocol than the standards offered to me. On top of that, all my personal emails are with Gmail. If I didn't have it connected to Spark on my laptop idk what I would do. The Outlook website looks like the very definition of oversimplified modernism, to the point where it can be hard to differentiate between emails and sections. I noticed a considerable uptick in spam like everyone was mentioning this summer (on top of the spam ads and newsletters that IU automatically signs us up for!) and I just wish I could have everything in one place again.

So what are everyone's thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/x2e7tl/switch_from_gmail_to_outlook/,werosmys,1,2022-08-31 09:53:22,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/x2e7tl/switch_from_gmail_to_outlook/

x3xjwv,Stolen Bike," Hey peeps! 

So I know that this is a long shot, but I'm posting it just in case someone has seen this mountain bike somewhere in Bloomington. It was stolen recently, and I have filed an insurance claim so that I can get the money back for it, but it'd be great if I could just get the bike back instead of buying a new one. I used a cable lock to lock it to the bike rack that it was parked at, which was cut, so I'll use this as a chance to tell people that it is probably better to get a u-lock even if it can be a bit more cumbersome to deal with.

x90upt,Seeking cofounders to help reignite stalled AI-based summarization tool startup.,"Hey all,  
 

A few years ago, I, along with a couple of other people created a startup around a product idea that was meant to be an advanced and efficient summarization AI model, which would create abstractive, nonplagiarized summaries while retaining the essence of the text being summarized. Surprisingly, we were able to at least implement aspects of our product idea, even creating a somewhat finished test app around the product and really developing the other aspects of the project, with a host of pitch decks, investor contact lists, and executive summaries. Things were turning so well for us in fact, that we even were able to get a meeting with the CEO of Snapchat. However, nothing came to fruition from that as we had hoped, and due to a variety of compounding factors such as school, work, and especially team communication, one by one, the other members of the project left(as well as relinquishing their legal involvement with this project), leaving just me with the pieces. However, I still have much of our investor/business material and work on my google drive, and can likely gain access to the majority of tech aspects of our project(the unfinished app, base code/AI algorithm, etc).  So, even though over 90 percent of startups fail, I believe that this project deserves to be reignited, that's why I am looking for skilled cofounders(particularly in Biz Dev, tech, and marketing) that would be of course EQUAL equity, and who are motivated in making sure this project beats that statistic!  
As for a bit of background on me, I am a college student, with a passion for exploring new ideas and have thrown myself into a wide area of diverse projects, which have allowed me to gain a variety of unique and impactful experiences that I believe will translate well into the startup field. If you're interested in becoming a co-founder of this project, just hit me up with a DM anytime!",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/x90upt/seeking_cofounders_to_help_reignite_stalled/,Classic-Brilliant678,1,2022-09-08 09:41:50,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/x90upt/seeking_cofounders_to_help_reignite_stalled/

xd97ec,Who Killed Ann Harmeier?,"# How Ann Harmeier vanished from the side of a busy highway in 1977

A murder mystery that’s stumped police for 45 years started in broad daylight on a clear, crisp September morning along a busy stretch of highway near Martinsville.

That’s where Indiana University junior Ann Harmeier vanished after her car broke down while driving to Bloomington. The 20-year-old theater major was returning from a weekend trip home to Cambridge City to visit her mother and a family friend who’d had a health scare.

The disappearance generated national attention about the missing young woman and the impact on her small hometown, where hundreds rallied to do whatever they could to help bring Ann home.

It was a cruel twist of fate that put Ann on the highway that day. She initially planned to head back to her off-campus apartment Sunday night, but her protective mother convinced her to wait. She didn’t think it was safe for a young woman to make the drive alone. Certainly not after dark.

Ann obliged, staying another night before heading out Monday morning. Her car loaded with clean laundry and books, she left Cambridge City for the last time about 8:15 a.m. on Sept. 12, 1977. The drive was about 120 miles. Even if she stopped for breakfast at a McDonalds along the way, she hoped to arrive in Bloomington in time her Physics for Poets class at 10:30 a.m.

Ann promised to let her mother know she'd made it back safely. She’d also agreed to be available to take a call at 11 that night from the family friend, who was expecting results from some medical tests.

But Ann didn’t show up for her physics class. And Marge Harmeier’s phone in Cambridge City didn’t ring.

That afternoon, a fellow student in IU’s theater department was surprised when the dependable classmate failed to show up for stage work. The student made some calls to mutual friends. No one had seen Ann.

As the hours passed, Ann’s mother grew more concerned. She began calling Ann's friends in Bloomington. None of them had seen or heard from her, either.

By Monday evening Marge was frantic. She couldn’t reach Ann. None of her friends in Bloomington had seen her. Then she missed the scheduled 11 p.m. call from the family friend.

Panicking and at a loss for what else to do, Marge and the Rev. Rose Taul, her pastor at Cambridge City Presbyterian church, headed to Bloomington to see if they could find Ann.

**Ann's car found abandoned**

It was around 1:30 a.m. Sept. 13, as they approached Martinsville on Ind. 37, that the two women spotted Ann's 1971 Pontiac LeMans. The car was parked on the berm near the bridge over Clear Creek, about two miles north of Martinsville.

The doors were locked. There was no sign of a problem. No sign of a struggle. And no sign of Ann.

Taul and Marge continued on to Bloomington, where they went to the Indiana State Police Post to file a missing person report.

They were caught off guard when police asked if it was possible that Ann wanted to disappear or left on her own.

“The initial response … was that Ann would probably turn up soon and that she was probably just with friends or a boy,” said Scott Burnham, a second cousin who’s spent the last four years working to keep Ann’s memory alive in hopes of finally finding her killer.

It wasn't an uncommon response when someone goes missing, at least not initially, and particularly not a college student in the 1970s. But it only added to Marge's concern, Burnham said, because it just wasn't the kind of thing Ann would do.

Undaunted, the women continued looking for Ann. They checked her apartment, then sought out one Ann’s oldest friends — a classmate from Cambridge City who also was at IU.

“I lived in a sorority on campus, and Mrs. Harmeier came that morning,” said Emily Hershberger Turchyn. “They called me over the intercom to come down. It was early, I’m going to say very early in the morning, and she was asking if I’d had any contact with Ann. Had I heard anything from her? And of course, I hadn’t.”

Turchyn said Marge asked her to stay at Ann’s apartment while they continued looking for Ann. Recounting that day resurrected the flood of emotions Turchyn felt at the time. The fears she had for her missing friend. The sympathy she felt for Ann’s desperate mother. The sense of hopelessness. Four decades later, thinking back to that day still makes her cry.

“I did stay,” Turchyn said through tears. “I was having trouble with that, so I called up my dad and he came and stayed with me, too. We stayed all night begging for phone calls.”

They waited, but Ann’s phone didn’t ring.

Police did check Ann's car later that morning. Her suitcase, textbooks and laundry were found inside. The emergency flashers were been turned on, but the battery was dead. The rust-colored Pontiac was towed to Martinsville for storage.

Burnham said the tenor of the search for Ann quickly changed. He attributes the about-face, at least in part, to nudges from people at IU and in Cambridge City.

“My aunt Marjorie was friends with a retired ISP detective, Ernie Adler, who lived near Cambridge City,” he said. “He became deeply involved in the investigation, and I believe his influence in making it happen weighed heavily on law enforcement. I also think that the administration at IU made it clear at the beginning stages that this just wasn't a case of a coed who went off the to party.”

Tom Gray was driving to Martinsville from Greenfield the afternoon Ann vanished. The retired Morgan County judge, who was the county prosecutor in 1977, said he remembers passing Ann’s car as he returned home. Gray had just started the murder trial of a man who killed a reserve sheriff’s deputy. Because of the local publicity, the trial was moved to Hancock County.

“On the way back there, at what I know as Eskew Hill, was her car, with the lights flashing,” Gray said, “and I didn’t think too much of it.”

He had no reason to at that point. That was hours before Ann was reported missing. A call the next day about a young woman who failed to show up at IU drew him into the case.

“From there,” he said, “we opened up an investigation.”

**Disappearance prompts massive investigation**

As word spread about Ann’s disappearance, police began to get tips.

The driver of a Greyhound bus said he saw a woman fitting Ann’s description standing by a car on the side of the road. There was another vehicle pulled off behind it.

Another motorist reported seeing a blue pickup truck behind Ann’s car.

An IU professor told police he heard someone on the CB radio say a vehicle that looked like an unmarked police car was parked off the highway behind the Pontiac. The person on the CB used the handle “Little Diesel.”

State police searched parts of the Morgan-Monroe State Forest near Martinsville.

Four days after Ann disappeared — Sept. 16 — her car was towed back to where it had been found. As a helicopter circled overhead looking any signs of Ann, police stopped nearly 1,000 cars. They were looking for daily commuters who may have seen anything unusual that Monday morning on the busy four-lane stretch of highway.

Ann Harmeier disappeared Sept. 12, 1977, after her car broke down near this spot along Ind. 37 north of Martinsville. Five weeks later, her body was found in a cornfield about five miles away.

Six people said they saw Ann standing beside her car. Three said they stopped to offer help. No one knew what happened to her.

The following Monday, a week to the day after Ann disappeared, police set up another roadblock to see if anyone recalled seeing Ann or anyone else near her car.

The initial investigation didn’t turn up any strong leads, but it helped investigators piece together a timeline that revealed Ann’s car was overheating. They determined she’d made at least two stops to address the problem on her way to Bloomington.

Ann stopped and bought a new radiator cap on the south side of Indianapolis. She stopped again at a Deep Rock service station in Waverly, about eight miles north of where her car was found. No mechanic was on duty, but another customer helped fill her radiator with water before she headed south again.

Police said they checked out — and cleared — the man who helped Ann that morning at Waverly.

When her car overheated again, Ann pulled over on Eskew Hill. That was the last place anyone reported seeing her.

Community pulls together to help find Ann

Back in Cambridge City, Marge tried to put up a strong front as hours turned into days with no sign of her daughter. The widowed school music teacher, whose husband died when Ann was 4, prayed for her safe return.

“She was terrified of what was going on with her child, or had gone on, as I think any mother would be,” said Linda Haywood, one of Ann’s cousins. “I think not knowing is just torture. And that's what the poor woman was going through. She tried to be very brave and courageous.”

Haywood learned from her mother that Ann was missing. The phone call was devastating. She was in her bedroom, Haywood said, and it was early in the evening after Marge had returned from Bloomington.

“My mother called with the news and she was pretty broken up and pretty frightened because, of course, Marjorie was terribly frightened. I guess my voice must have relayed alarm,” Haywood said. “Our children were upstairs playing in their rooms and they soon were all around me and listening to the conversation. And there were tears, and many, many questions that I couldn't answer — and still can’t.”

Haywood said Ann's extended family clung to hope. There had to be something they were missing.

“That’s what I tried to tell the children,” she said. “You know, it was so early on that surely there was an explanation.”

Her children’s innocent questions only added to the challenge of staying positive.

“They would ask me, ‘What do you think happened to an Ann, Mommy? What do you think Ann is thinking right now, Mommy?’” Haywood recalled. “Those are questions that are very hard to answer.”

Residents of the small Wayne County town about 25 miles west of Richmond quickly mobilized to search for Ann and to support Marge.

Residents of Cambridge City and Bloomington worked tirelessly in the fall of 1977 to keep the disappearance Ann Harmeier in front of the public.

A community prayer service was conducted two days after Ann disappeared.

A second community meeting days later drew about 1,000 people — nearly half the town’s population. At the meeting, they adopted a slogan — “Where is Ann?” — that appeared on posters, billboards and bumper stickers. A local printer rushed out 5,000 posters, and 100 people volunteered to quickly spread them around the state.

The principal at one of the schools where Marge taught and some other community leaders started a Search and Rescue Fund committee. Teachers who worked with Marge donated $5,000 to offer a reward for information about what happened to Ann.

Cambridge City’s annual Canal Days, the small community’s largest celebration, went on under a pall. Organizers pulled together a hasty tribute to Ann, who had been crowned queen of the festival in 1974.

But there was a downside to the growing attention on the case.

The publicity prompted a bogus $25,000 ransom request called in to an Indianapolis TV station. And Marge received crank calls, prompting volunteers to stay with her and take phone messages.

This 1977 newspaper clip shows Marjorie Harmeier reading The Palladium-Item during the time when her daughter, Ann Harmeier, was missing.

“I do all right as long as I’m teaching. I don’t breakdown when I’m in the classroom,” Marge said in an interview with The Richmond Palladium-Item newspaper. “When I get home, it’s a different story.”

As the days turned into weeks, at least three clairvoyants were consulted or offered help. Marge, a devout Christian, accepted the help. She was desperate.

“All I can say is that we are grasping at straws right now,"" she said. ""We’ve run out of clues.”

The reward fund quickly ballooned to more than $10,000. Other donations were used to hire a private investigator. Taul and some others checked a tip Ann could be in Kentucky after a Morgan County gas station operator said he saw her in a car with Kentucky license plates. It caught his attention, he said, because the young woman was wearing a red Indiana T-shirt like the one Ann had on the day she disappeared.

The trip turned up no signs of Ann, a newspaper account said, but Taul ended up praying with about 50 people at a commune.

Members of service clubs such as Kiwanis and Rotary spread the word about Ann through their state organizations. The Search and Rescue committee solicited help from private detectives.

National wire services and ""The Today"" Show ran reports about the missing girl dubbed “everyone’s daughter.”

Members of a church in North Carolina who heard about Ann held a prayer service. Requests for bumper stickers poured in from across the U.S.

**A heartbroken mother prepares for the worst**

Ann’s mother continued to grow more pessimistic. She revealed in an interview with the Bloomington Herald-Telephone that Ann had questioned returning to school for her third year. The summer in Cambridge City, Ann told her, had been “too good to be true.”

She also revealed in the interview that Ann made a request that proved prophetic. She asked Taul to take care of Marge if anything ever happened to her.

On Oct. 13, one month after Marge and Taul found Ann’s abandoned car, Cambridge City held a community day of prayer. Hundreds invoked God’s help in bringing Ann home — and alive.

In this 1977 newspaper clip, the Rev. Rose Taul comforts Marjorie Harmeier at the funeral of her daughter, Ann Harmeier. Ann's 11-year-old cousin, Scott Burnham, is standing behind them. Now 55, he is working to find Ann's killer.

But in an interview three days later with the Associated Press, Marge admitted she was ready to accept a parent's worst nightmare. She just wanted an answer, even if that meant learning her precious daughter was dead.

“I’d rather find Ann and put her with her daddy at the cemetery,” she said, “than not know.”

Two days later, a farmer picking corn about five miles from where her car was found, came across a body.

The young woman who had come to be known as “everyone’s daughter” had been murdered. The community that worked so hard to find her by spreading the message “Where is Ann?” didn't quit, though. It took up a new rallying cry.

xd9gd2,Who Killed Ann Harmeier?,"# Who killed Ann Harmeier? A distant cousin pushes for answers in 45-year-old murder mystery

Scott Burnham has a recurring dream.

He's at a dive bar in the middle of nowhere. The parking lot is full. Music fills the air.

Inside, a band is playing Neil Young's song ""Like a Hurricane."" The dance floor is packed. Burnham spots his cousin standing on the other side of the room. She smiles and waves at him.

He tries to make his way to her but gets lost in the swirling crowd.

""I'm so close,"" he says, ""but I can never get to her.""

**Who killed Ann?**

Scott Burnham was 10 when his cousin, Ann Harmeier was murdered in 1977; The crime remains unsolved. But Burnham wants to solve the mystery.

KELLY WILKINSON, INDIANAPOLIS STAR

Burnham describes the dream as we drive east along a narrow road that undulates through the rolling countryside north of Martinsville. He’s 200 miles away from his home in the Chicago suburbs, but he knows this arrow-straight road. Every farmhouse and barn. Every hill. Every field and stream.

The 55-year-old has been up and down the stretch of Egbert Road many times before. And our trip won’t be his last on the blacktop that takes him not only deep into the country, but also back in time.

Burnham points out key landmarks along the way. A wooded area where a biker gang hosted wild parties that raged long into the night. A church that looks like a farm building with a steeple. It's new, he tells me. On one of his other visits he stopped to talk to the minister.

His maroon Toyota SUV takes us past a few farmhouses, then a new subdivision. In the summer of 2021, he showed up there with a plastic wagon full of cold beer. Burnham figured knocking on the doors of strangers with an offer of free beer would be a good way to meet people. He was right.

We roll on a few more miles. A classic rural Indiana tableau loops past the windshield: pastures, patches of woods, fields of soybeans and corn. After about 4 miles, Burnham slows the SUV as we approach a road that leads north. He stops to let a pickup truck clear the intersection, then turns left.

This road is even more narrow and isolated. Not a house or building in sight. The SUV’s tires hum on the rough surface as we slowly roll north a few hundred yards before Burnham pulls to the side of the road and stops.

We are deep in the country now. It could be the middle-of-nowhere setting from his dream. But there’s no dive bar. No packed parking lot. No pulsing Neil Young music. Just another giant field of corn like so many others we passed along the way. Neat ribbons of green stretch out to the east as far as we can see, the tall stalks swaying gently in a light breeze.

This may not be the place in Burnham’s dream, but it is where he finally reconnects with his cousin. 

Out there, way back in the cornfield, he tells me, looking to the east: “That’s where they found Ann’s body.”

**A race against time to find Ann's killer**

It doesn't take a psychologist to parse Burnham's dream. For the last four years, he's been on a remarkable mission to answer a question that's haunted his family and eluded investigators for 45 years: Who killed his cousin Ann Harmeier?

Future looked bright for Ann Harmeier, the young Indiana woman dubbed 'everybody's daughter'

The Indiana University junior disappeared Sept. 12, 1977, as she returned to Bloomington from a weekend trip home to Cambridge City in eastern Indiana. The only sign of the 20-year-old was her abandoned car. It was found early the following morning parked on the side of Ind. 37 north of Martinsville on a long incline locals call Eskew Hill.

Five weeks later, a farmer picking corn discovered Ann's body in a field about fives miles from where her abandoned car was found. She had been raped and strangled.

Burnham brought me to the field because he is in a race against time. He knows the longer Ann’s murder goes unsolved, the less likely it is his family will ever get an answer. The investigation that once included seven full-time investigators had grown cold, the files and evidence sitting idle and gathering dust for years.

Some of the detectives who worked on the case have died. Others are retired, dealing with memory loss and health issues. Ann’s killer may be dead by now, too. The same goes for people who could know something.

There’s not much of Ann’s family left, either. She was an only child. Her parents are dead. Burnham is one of a handful of distant relatives who knew Ann as more than the girl from yellowed newspaper clippings tucked in a shoebox or the family Bible.

The saga of Ann's life and death has been told dozens of times since 1977, but now it's become a central part of Burnham's story, too. And he believes his push may be the last hope of keeping her memory alive and finally finding the killer.

That’s why he’s here with me on a late-summer afternoon, parked beside a cornfield in a remote part of Morgan County. That’s why he spends hours every week chasing down leads. Why he knocks on the doors of strangers offering free beer, hoping for that one critical tip. Why he started a social media campaign and pitches Ann’s story to anyone willing to listen. And why he’s lobbied everyone from the governor and lawmakers to the state police superintendent and president of Indiana University to help solve not only Ann's case, but the hundreds of other cold cases lingering across Indiana.

Scott Burnham visits the cornfield where his cousin, Ann Harmeier, was found murdered in 1977. Burnham, who was 10 when she died, began searching for Ann's killer about four years ago.

Most of all, that's why he just can’t let it go. 

“What else am I going to do,"" he tells me, ""power wash my deck or watch 'Ted Lasso'? That’s for people who give up.”

**An unlikely candidate for the task**

For a person who's invested so much time, energy and emotional capital into the case, Burnham barely knew Ann when she was alive.

They were second cousins. Their grandmothers were sisters. He grew up in Michigan City, more than 200 miles from Ann’s home in Cambridge City. He was only 10 when she disappeared. The age difference and distance made it difficult to have a connection beyond a loose family tie.

Burnham started his quest with only a handful of vague memories of his cousin. Most center around family holiday gatherings. They were together only about 10 times.

Stasia Forsythe Siena, a lifelong friend who has followed Burnham's work on the case, said that tenuous relationship is one of the things that makes his commitment to solving her murder so compelling.

""You know, it's not like Ann was his favorite cousin that he spent all this time with, and therefore, it led to this incredible journey to solve this cold case,"" she said. ""That, to my mind, points to his sense of justice and the idea of a bigger issue here than just the death of his cousin.""

Still, there was something about Ann that made a lasting impression.

She was the cool older kid who was into theater and the latest music. But the thing Burnham remembers most is how Ann sincerely seemed to want to know more about him.

“She really made me feel special,” he said, “because she was interested in the things that I was doing as a 10-year-old kid.”

One of Burnham’s earliest memories of Ann is when she and her mother visited Michigan City. It was around Christmas. At one point, Ann and her mother sat down at the piano and started singing. Burnham remembers being in awe of their talent. It was like the von Trapp family from ""The Sound of Music"" dropped by to sing Christmas carols.

Burnham’s last memory of Ann is from 1976, about a year before she was murdered.

His sister Liz had enrolled at IU, too, and was studying dance. The family drove down from Michigan City to see her in a production of ""Swan Lake."" Ann stopped by the Bloomington hotel where they were staying. He remembers her breezing in wearing bellbottom blue jeans and a turtleneck sweater under a brown suede coat awash in flowing leather fringe.

“I was like, this is the coolest person I know,"" he said, ""and she's actually interested in what my life is like.”

As final memories go, it was a classic walk off. But the notion it would be the last time he would see Ann alive never crossed his mind that day.

**Life goes on in aftermath of murder**

Siena, who met Burnham in elementary school, still recalls hearing about Ann's murder when they were in the fifth grade.

""I remember thinking, 'Oh wow, his cousin has been killed!'"" she said. ""But it kind of just came and went. It's more just a distant memory.""

In hindsight, she said, it strikes her ""how little it impacted us at the time."" And after seeing the effort Burnham has put into finding Ann's killer, Siena has wondered if she and other friends failed to grasp the impact it had on him.

""I've asked him many times in the process of this unfolding, 'Did we do enough?' like, 'Did we miss somehow as your close friends that this was such an impactful event in your lives?' And he said 'no,'"" she said.

Burnham occasionally talked to his older brother and sister about what happened to Ann, but it wasn't something his parents discussed. Part of that may have been the times, he said, and part of it was probably their attempt to protect what was left of their children's innocence.

Besides, while no one was arrested or convicted of Ann's murder, a key investigator told her mother they knew who the killer was — even if they didn't have enough evidence to prove it in court. And there was no need to worry, because that man, Steven Judy, was executed in 1981 for a similar murder two years later in Morgan County.

So life rushed on as his memories of Ann and the murder faded.

Burnham finished grade school and middle school. He graduated from high school and earned degrees from the University of Michigan and Northwestern. He married and started a career. Soon, he had children of his own. His focus was aimed squarely on the future.

It wasn't until 40 years later that two events jogged his memories of Ann.

The first was a dreaded summons to serve jury duty. Like a lot of people, Burnham ""went kicking and screaming.” He had a lot to do at work and no time for other people's drama. Ultimately, he was dismissed. But not before a routine jury pool question nudged him toward the road to that cornfield north of Martinsville.

“The judge asked if anybody's family member had been a victim of violent crime,” Burnham said. “And I suddenly remembered about Ann.”

But his childhood memories were fuzzy. So later that day, Burnham called his sister. He asked what she remembered about the case — and if Ann's killer had ever been found.

His sister reminded Burnham what police had told Ann’s mother, who went to her grave in 1983 believing Judy killed her precious, only daughter.

That explanation was enough, for then, to satisfy Burnham’s curiosity.

He returned to his busy life as a husband, father, and a communications and public affairs strategist in Chicago.

It was another moment in 2018, after the Golden State Killer was arrested in California, that pushed Burnham down the rabbit hole.

“I remember listening to the radio on my way to work and one of the news stories mentioned that he was caught because of DNA that they found at one of the crime scenes in the mid-70s, which was around the time Ann died,” he said.

Was there any DNA evidence, he wondered, in Ann’s case?

That night, Burnham went home and started Googling old newspaper stories that might provide the answer or any possible clues. He didn’t find any information about a suspect ever being publicly being identified, arrested or convicted in Ann’s murder. Nothing about DNA. What he did find was a story from the Bloomington newspaper about Jim Allison, a retired IU professor who wrote a manuscript in the mid-1990s about the investigation of Ann’s disappearance and murder.

Burnham called Allison. If that conversation had confirmed the recollection of Burnham’s sister — that Judy was Ann’s killer — that may have been the end of this story. Burnham could have gone back to his normal routine.

But that’s not how this story goes.

“He told me that Steven Judy was not the killer because he had been incarcerated on an unrelated charge in Marion County at the time,"" Burnham recalled. ""There was no possible way could have done it.”

It was, he said, his aha moment.

“That's when I became more interested in finding out who the killer was.”

**Career path prepared him for the task**

Burnham was uniquely qualified to pursue the case, both because of his passion for finding justice for a victim he'd barely known and because of his resume.

As a former newspaper reporter, he knew how to mine public records, find people, and get them to talk. Working in politics and state government taught him how to negotiate bureaucracies to get things done. His experience in public affairs and lobbying provided insights on who to schmooze, who to nudge and how to get attention.

Siena said that's all true, but there's more to the guy she grew up calling Scotty B than a list of professional achievements.

""Even outside of the world of his professional life,"" she said, ""Scott has always been a fairly charismatic figure who kind of very quietly brought people together.""

She jokingly, maybe, called it his ""super power.""

It is obvious to people who’ve been around Ann’s case for years that Burnham is a unique character. The tell goes beyond his persistence and drive that puts off some Hoosiers who roll at a different frequency. He’s doesn't hesitate to go over people’s heads or, more likely, start at the top. He has no qualms pushing back on closed doors.

His unrelenting approach makes some suspicious about his motives. One longtime law enforcement official connected to the case told me several others involved in the investigation warned him to steer clear of Burnham. The intense Chicagoan tracked them down, peppered them with questions. He challenged some of their core assumptions and asked for sensitive information. They didn’t trust him, I was told, but about the worst anyone could say was that he might be making a podcast that would put police in a bad light.

""I'd recommended,"" the source told me, ""that you steer clear of him.""

It was too late by then.

**Restaurant meeting turns into two-year project**

I connected with Burnham in the summer of 2020 after a mutual acquaintance told me about his work trying to solve Ann's murder. Our first meeting was a small restaurant in Martinsville. He impressed me as serious, organized, committed and, most importantly, not full-blown crazy.

He told me he wasn't a true-crime junkie, or into ghost chasing or conspiracy theories.

""I look at it more as a puzzle,"" he explained. ""You find bits and pieces of it, and maybe some of them fit. But most don't. You just have to keep searching for the rest of them and move them around until they connect.""

Burnham was about two years into his journey at that point. He'd had some success, but things weren’t progressing nearly as fast as he hoped. Maybe he’d just watched too much ""CSI""?

When he started, Burnham said he saw his goal as black or white. If he didn't solve the case he'd fail.

“I think he went into this thinking he was going to be able to maybe figure some things out, he's going to have the cooperation he needed, some crazy evidence would show up from the police and it would be solved. It would a be fantastic revelation,” Burnham's wife, Monika, told me. “And it hasn't been.”

He described the experience “like a roller coaster that moves really slowly with a lot more lows than highs.”

But his effort hasn’t been all disappointment and frustration. He discovered so much more about Ann and her life than he knew as a 10-year-old boy. He reconnected with his extended family. He made new acquaintances and friends. He learned more about himself.

And here's the thing that sealed the deal for me. He admitted that, initially, had no interest in other cold cases. Trying to solve Ann's murder was all he could handle. But by the time we met, Burnham had come off that stance. He couldn't ignore the thousands of other cold cases in Indiana and across the U.S. He knows many of those victims are people of color or from other marginalized groups and, unlike Ann, their deaths went relatively unnoticed. Few have advocates.

“I'm lucky that I had a sense of how to navigate through some of the bureaucracy and the politics and the media when it comes to Ann's case,” he said. “But I think a lot of families don't have those resources or knowledge or wherewithal to know where to begin.”

So, he started asking Indiana State Police for more than just access to records from the investigation into Ann's death. He also began pushing ISP to establish a dedicated cold-case unit.

But that’s getting ahead of the story.

Could this nosy cousin be Ann's killer?

Burnham first contacted state police in August 2018 after hearing about the Golden State Killer.

He wanted to know what, if anything, was happening with the case and a chance to review the investigation files. His primary objective was to learn if there was DNA evidence that could be tested.

Instead, Burnham said, he ran into one roadblock after another. At one point he was told the files couldn’t be shared because if he was the killer, he might learn details about the direction of the investigation. That left him scratching his head.

“I told them, incredulously, that I was 10 years old at the time of Ann's death,” he said. “I lived 200 miles away, and I was in the fifth grade at the time, and I couldn't drive so there was no way I could possibly be the killer.”

As strong as that argument seemed to him, it didn’t change minds. So he filed a public records request. It was swiftly denied, too. As long as the case is open, despite the apparent lack of activity for years, police didn’t have to share the records. He appealed to the Indiana Public Access Counselor and lost.

When retelling the story, it's clear Burnham is still chafed by one particular statement during the back and forth: “You don’t know what type of a person your cousin was,” he was told. “Once you go digging around, you might uncover some things you wish you hadn’t seen.”

He’s still not sure what to make of it. But it revealed the person he was dealing with didn’t really know much about Ann. She had a 3.8 GPA at IU. She was deeply religious and highly regarded in her hometown. One of the lead ISP investigators noted her character in an interview after she vanished, calling Ann “everybody’s daughter.” The description caught on and was picked up by the media.

The refusal was frustrating for another reason, too. Police haven’t always been so tight-lipped. The case files have been opened to others, most notably Allison in the 1990s. He wrote about seeing unpublished photos from the crime scene and other details shared by investigators.

Burnham’s friend, Siena, said she’s seen him change as he digs deeper into the mystery his family was led to believe had been solved.

“I think that he learned that the story that you're told is not always true — and if you're going to get to the truth, you might just have to take up that journey on your own,” she said.

**Taking his case to the streets, Internet**

In early 2019, Burnham started reaching out to Gov. Eric Holcomb, U.S. Rep. Greg Pence (whose district includes Cambridge City), state Sen. Rodric Bray (Morgan County), U.S. Attorney Zachary Myers and others. None offered to help. Most simply pointed Burnham back to state police.

Disappointed but undaunted, he turned to the streets and the Internet.

Working nights and weekends, around his day job and family obligations, he made scores of phone calls and about a dozen trips to Martinsville, Bloomington, Cambridge City and Indianapolis. In Cambridge City, he set up an information table at the annual Canal Days festival. He was buoyed by the positive response. So many people still remembered Ann, who had been festival queen in 1974, and shared stories he’d never heard.

His circle of inquiry spiraled outward from there.

“I've spoken with hundreds of people, including people who were friends with Ann in grade school, people who were at the field at the time that her body was found, cops who interviewed Steven Judy, private detectives, Ann’s ex-boyfriend, lawyers, true crime enthusiast, citizens sleuths, you name it,” he said. “I've even had people who tell me that Ann has come to them in a vision and told them where to look for clues.”

He also launched a social media campaign, reviving the question Who Killed Ann? His posts are written as if they come from Ann, and he intentionally makes many of them edgy. Things like:

What’s a girl gotta do to get a cop to make an arrest?

My New Year’s resolutions aren’t that different from most 20-year-olds: eat healthier; make more time for myself; and find the guy who raped and killed me.

The tone doesn’t sit well with some family and friends. They complain Ann would never say such things, that the comments tarnish her reputation. Burnham doesn’t disagree but said the sass and snark serve a purpose.

“I didn’t want it to be some gooey memorial page with a bunch of people boo-hooing about their memories or about how much they missed her,” he explained, “because I wanted to find her killer.”

Three years later, he still gets called out for some posts. One on Aug. 28 marked what would have been Ann’s 65th birthday. It included a school photo of the fresh-faced Ann.

Here's what 65 looks like! Take note ladies, not a wrinkle or gray hair in sight. Attribute that to staying out of the sun all these years.

It was too much for a Cambridge City woman.

“Ann would have never said most of the stuff you pretend to portray her as,” she chided Burhman. “It is of zero help to the cause. Do better. Stop.”

The ruffled feathers extend beyond friends and family. A police officer recently told Burnham his superiors at ISP don’t like the social media campaign. The message was basically “she should shut up,” he was advised.

“I told him that I would pass it along to her,” Burnham replied, “but she probably wasn’t going to listen.”

Despite his slow start start with state police, Burnham is making some headway. Most notably, ISP assigned the case to Det. Ian Matthews, who is based at the Bloomington post. He's moved past the earlier conflicts.

""Having an adversarial relationship is a losing proposition,"" Burnham said. ""It doesn't do anyone any good, and it's not going to solve this case.""

State police wouldn't let me talk with Matthews, but public information officer Sgt. Michael Wood confirmed the investigation remains open.

""This has lasted so long that we have several generations of troopers that have worked this,"" he said. ""We don't close the door, I mean, it's not fair to the family or this community on any of our cases, to close the door on an investigation. Of course, we have more investigations that come in, and you're trying to balance that the best we can.""

Wood declined to say if ISP had any DNA that has been or could be tested. He also declined to describe the type of evidence that exists 45 years later.

In early 2021, Burnham got a face-to-face meeting with Superintendent Douglas Carter. He pressed Carter to establish a cold-case unit. He even came with a plan to fund the team.

Burnham called me after the meeting. He was cautiously optimistic. Carter wasn’t interested in his funding plan, Burnham said, but agreed there is a real need to shine more light on old cases.

Eighteen months later, ISP still doesn’t have a cold-case unit. But Burnham remains hopeful as he keeps digging.

His efforts have generated tips, some better than the others. He’s pretty convinced the killer was local and has developed a list of about 10 potential suspects.

""I think there's a lot of people who were questioned at the time, who were dismissed for one reason or another, who I think are worth following up with,"" he said.

He also wonders if Ann’s killer may have had ties to law enforcement or was impersonating a police officer.

Ann was too cautious and disciplined, he said, to get into a car with just anyone. It would have to be someone she trusted and felt safe to leave with. And all signs point to her leaving on her own. She took her purse with her, and there were no signs of struggle at her car.

""There's still a lot more that could and needs to be done. DNA can be evaluated. More leads can be tracked down. New suspects can be questioned,"" he said. ""I’m convinced that someone in Martinsville is the key to cracking the case.”

**How does this story end?**

Forty-five years after Ann Harmeier was abducted, raped and strangled — and four years after Burnham dove into the case — how does this story end? How much longer is he willing to keep working on the puzzle? Is there any acceptable result short of finding Ann's killer?

""When I started, I told myself I'd give it a year,"" he said. ""So much for that, right?""

Burnham told me his end goal remains the same: Finding the killer and, if the person still is alive, bringing them to justice. The best chance of that happening, he said, is through DNA evidence or someone coming forward with information. He's also excited about the work being done by Matthews and ISP.

""I think there's renewed interest in the case and I think that ISP has new ideas and some new ways of approaching it,"" he said. ""They're not shrugging their shoulders and saying 'there's nothing we can do.' It's a commitment on their part that my family really appreciates.""

He sees the 45th anniversary as an opportunity to raise public awareness and maybe shake loose the tip that will lead to Ann's killer. And he's looking beyond just her case.

""When I first started, I would have told you that this is a zero-sum game. Either you win or you lose when it comes to achieving your primary goal, which is finding the killer. But I guess that thinking has changed a bit,"" Burnham told me last week.

""If I'm able to help put some more funding and resources for law enforcement to solve cold cases, whether it's cracking Ann's case or someone else's murder, I'd consider that a win.""

xhfchd,Questions about Indiana University,"Hi everyone!

I am currently a high school senior in North Carolina right now and I'm planning on applying to Indiana University. I was recommended by my Spanish teacher to apply to Indiana University for a Spanish major since I've heard the linguistics program is really great! I'm also planning on double majoring Spanish with a Religious Studies major.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to ask a few questions about Indiana.

How is student life? (I know that the social life in Indiana is really great! But I'm going to be very honest I am more introverted so I was wondering whether an introvert can also fit in at Indiana?)

What do you like about Indiana? What do you dislike?

For people coming out-of-state, was it hard transitioning?

For anyone in the Spanish major, what do you like about the Spanish major program? What do you dislike? Any suggestions before becoming a Spanish major?

How is the religious studies program? 

Also I was wondering how much they grant for out of state students for merit scholarships. I'm hoping that my application will be strong enough where I might be considered for the Dean Scholarship but on the website it states amount varies. Does anyone by any chance know anything about how much can be granted to out of state student?

xndj95,Why Am I Getting Yelled at From Cars?,"Just an hour or so ago, I got off of the late shift from working at one of the libraries. I waited at an intersection, the one right in front of village pantry, and I heard a car pull up beside me. The cars were rolled down and someone inside started barking at me. I knew where this was going so I ignored them, staring ahead. But then came the ""Hey! HEY!"" The light turned green and the car pulled away, but I saw a car full of young men filming me with their phones. I wish I had thought to take a picture of their license plate number, but my legs were shaking.

It seems like this semester, I've been yelled at from cars in the exact same way a handful of times. It's always a car full of the stereotypical frat boys (sorry) with their windows rolled down who stop at a light or a stop sign. It doesn't matter if I'm alone or what I'm wearing. (Though, when I am alone, they're much more bold.) 

My guess is that these boys are finding some cruel humor in it for themselves or they're trying to be a big man in front of their brothers. 

But for a woman walking alone, this sort of occurrence is extremely disturbing. To be frank, whenever this happens to me, I think to myself, is this it? Is this the time that they go further than just yelling from a car? And when the moment passes, I get so incredibly angry. Why hadn't I screamed at them? Or thought to take a picture of their car? Anytime I see a car with it's windows rolled down, I tense.

If you know someone someone who does this sort of thing or if you see it happen in front of you, please say something. I'm hoping that if they understood how threatening that sort of behavior is, they'd stop. But, in the mean time, I'm getting a knife.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/xndj95/why_am_i_getting_yelled_at_from_cars/,emmcalla,1,2022-09-25 00:34:35,0,/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/xndj95/why_am_i_getting_yelled_at_from_cars/

Nowhere on any Scholartrack sites, IU sites, or in.gov sites does it suggest that taking classes outside of your degree plan will cause you to lose your 21c scholarship. I had to search to find a [pdf](https://www.in.gov/che/files/Financial-Aid-Manual_10_23_17.pdf) that says as much, yet there is seemingly no way to access this pdf from any of the above sites.

I am a student at IU and will be graduating this December. I am subleasing my 1 room 1 bathroom place at the Reserve and Third apartments. The apartment is a 3 Bed 3 Bath house but you will get your own bedroom and an attached private bathroom. The rent is only $549!! The rent includes water, gas, trash, and wifi! You will only have to pay for electricity (which is also shared with the other flatmates).
The bus stop for 6L and 6 is literally a minute away from the house. You can see the bus coming and going from the window itself.
It's also a community where many students live. Reserve on third also has its own shuttle which drops you at the university. They also have a pool, tennis courts and volley ballcourts.
The two other roommates you will be living with are super amazing. They are graduate students, non-smokers, and non-drinkers.
Please feel free to DM me and I'd be happy to show you the place before sublease.

xvt5lo,Music recommendations 🎶 [project],"Spotify Recs, TikTok songs, DJ sets, AUX road trips with friends and the classic, “Wow, what is that song that’s playing in the cafe right now?” Often, we can easily tell whether we like a song by listening to just a short snippet of it.

So we built a program that takes a song and shortens it to the ""best"" 10-60 seconds to help you find your next favorite song, go through your discover weekly/release radar, and add to your playlists, faster.

It'll eventually learn what the ""best"" 10 seconds snippets are to you as you listen more. Uses genre/class/valence/song/weather/chorus/bridge and other factors.

Would love criticism/feedback, thanks! :)

y04r7r,A Few Questions from a Prospective Student,"Hello!  I am a prospective IUB graduate student and wanted to get a feel for the school before making any decisions.  For anyone (undergraduate, graduate, or faculty) involved in the anthropology department, what is the culture like in the department?  What are the opportunities and funding like and how do students and faculty interact?  I've heard people in other schools complain about cattiness and competition, but I'm inclined to believe that this is a graduate school problem more so than a specific school's problem.  For everyone else, what is Bloomington like?  I lived in Richmond, IN (I began my Bachelor's degree at IUE) and Connersville, IN before and hated both, so I'm anxious to get away from the closed-mindedness of small-town Indiana.  Feel free to vent, but I would very much so appreciate a balanced and realistic depiction of university life.

y0kkj2,Advice regarding medical absences,"I have to drop one of my classes this year due to my medical condition. I donr know if it would be considered chronic or not but the nature of the operation means that I have ups and lows in my condition.

I suffer from Osteochondritis Dissecans or OCD lesion and pretty much the bone from my knee joint started to detach due to the lack of blood flow. I have two spots on one knee and the Summer of '21 is when I had my first surgery. They removed the bone and now I have a nice size pothole there. The bone gets caught sometimes and it males it hard for me to move. I am in constant pain, dull at some times but searing in others. I can get an alograph but the risks are the long recovery time and the possibility of the bone graft failing. So staying like this is tje better option for now.

I talked with disability services last year and the begining of this year but they said due to the large influx of Freshman with disabilities, they can't accomadate me. Which sucks.

y1ivg7,How to get to UIUC from IU if you don’t have a car: A Guide,"With Halloweekend, coming up, I know a lot of IU students want to go to UIUC for parties etc.
As someone that’s been traveling there nearly every weekend, here’s a comprehensive guide on the best ways to get to UIUC: 

**Option 1: Greyhound**

Greyhound has bus service everyday from Indianapolis to Champaign. Unfortunately, there’s only one bus every day, and it leaves for Champaign at 7:10 AM.

The campus shuttle to Indy doesn’t service that early in the morning, so your only option is to Uber to Indianapolis to catch the bus on time. 

Summary: Uber to Indianapolis greyhound station leaving at 5:30AM (~$110 if ubering solo), and then a bus from Indianapolis to Champaign leaving at 7:10AM ($37/person)

Total: ~$150 (If traveling solo) and 4 hours

**Option 2: Flixbus to Chicago + Amtrak to Champaign**

This option is far cheaper for solo travelers. The only downside is how long it takes. 

Start by booking a FlixBus from Bloomington to chicago. It leaves at 3:30 PM on most days, and takes ~5 and a half hours to get there. 
Next, take an Amtrak from chicago to Champaign. The FlixBus drops you off across the street from the Amtrak station, and you’ll have approximately 45 minutes in between to board the train. 

Summary: Flixbus from Bloomington to chicago leaving at 3:30PM (~$35). Arrive at 7:15 CST and take the 8:10PM Amtrak from Chicago to Champaign, arriving at 10:30PM (~$22) 

Total: ~$57 and 8 hours

**Option 3: Zipcar **

Personally, I’ve never taken a Zipcar there, but if you’re traveling in a large group, this is likely the easiest option. Most zipcars cost around $70 to book per day, and you can book it for the weekend and split it across 4-5 people.


I hope this post helped! If you have a car/know anyone with a car that travels to UIUC, please shoot me a PM and I’d be happy to pay for gas if you can get me a ride.

y6idm2,Did I complete my IU essay incorrectly,"This was my essay I used for my IU specific essay

Throughout the entirety of my academic career I have faced a great number of challenges, but I can confidently say that I have grown through them. It's no secret looking at my transcript that my freshman year wasn’t very impressive; I could put it all on COVID but that wouldn't be very honest. I was uninspired and thought that education was unimportant. I believed school was the least of my worries because, around this time, I had to take a more active role in my house as my father was no longer there and my mother had to pick up more hours at work. This left me with a sister to take care of, more chores to do, and resulted in less effort academically. That being said, after my first semester of sophomore year my philosophy shifted. I fell in love with English; I was constantly reading, determined to learn as much as possible. Through books, such as “Sun Tzu Art of War '' by Sun Tzu and “The Odyssey” by Homer I have learned the importance of hard work and giving back to the community. That hard work is why I was able to bring my GPA from a 2.2 all the way up to a cumulative of 2.9 by obtaining an average gpa of 3.4 from the second semester of sophomore to the end of my junior year. I volunteered 240 hours at a summer camp that I hold very near to my heart. I was a counselor and tried to instill the same values of kindness and hard work into the children I worked with. I read books to them every night before they went to bed. On different weeks I read different books such as “The Giving Tree” by Shel Silverstein and “Where the Wild Things Are” by Maurice Sendak. On the last night of camp I would always read “Oh The Places You’ll Go” by Dr. Suess, then go around the cabin asking each kid what they wanted to do when they grew up. I did my best to give them faith that with enough hard work they could do anything. Similarly I have faith in myself that I can continue on my educational journey learning more about the world around me in hopes of making it a better place through dedication and philanthropy

I was exploratory and had no clue if I did it correctly.
