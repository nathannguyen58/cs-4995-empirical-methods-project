tu1d56,Is it possible to drop classes after deadline for health reasons?,"I've had some health problems lately. So plan to drop 2 classes to take care of myself. I have letters of support from my adviser and health provider, and signatures from my instructors. I'm in GSAS. Is it possible at all to drop classes after the invisible deadline without W/UW on my transcript? And if I get UW's would they affect my GPA? I didn't find much information on the official website so I'm freaking out üò≠üò≠üò≠ Thx for reading this

tu94gy,"A look back on the war on fun, 2021-2022","This year might not have had the biggest showing from Columbia and Co. against the fun and wellbeing of students since we've been back on campus as the pre-covid era, but we've had a handful of notable anti-fun events this year, including

1. Removal of 24 hour JJs
1a. Dining halls being so crowded that going to any of them during any normal food hours takes an extra hour out of your day
2. The no outside guest policy almost all of the year (which is still going to be wonky after they bring it back) 
3. D U o  a U t H e N t I C a t I o N
4. The multi month strike + admin's (lack of) response
5. That time they prevented students from visiting other dorms but ""its okay because covid can't spread during class"" 
5b. Inconsistent covid policies in general (removing all optional testing on campus the week before spring break) 
6. Bacchanal organizers dropping the ball like 5 times
7. Subreddit mods not looking at the date and removing meme posts
8. CPS and every other campus resource being so overbooked that it's impossible to meet with anyone
8b. Intro/major classes breaking in the 400-500s in size (looking at you, CS) 

What other similar moments do you remember from this year, from either Columbia or groups within, that I left out?",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/tu94gy/a_look_back_on_the_war_on_fun_20212022/,Snoop-o,1,2022-04-01 23:16:19,0,/r/columbia/comments/tu94gy/a_look_back_on_the_war_on_fun_20212022/

tup6kh,Is the visual arts mfa program worth experiencing?,"thinking about applying, with the goal of teaching art at the college level and continuing my art practice. 

i am looking for an immersive program that is kind to part time students. i have to continue to work full time to afford this. i worked full time to go to school part time for undergrad (thanks tuition remission) and plan on doing the same for my MFA if possible.

for undergrad, i went to a school that was statistically 70% white (i know, i know) students and the majority of those attending the school were very *very* rich. (i am neither of those things) this is all to day that the majority art that comes out of that school is pretty bad, and low-effort. i‚Äôm afraid columbia will be the same deal (elite rich kids making bad art and a lack of structure and challenging coursework)

i‚Äôm finding a lot of mixed reviews from pre-covid times online, so i‚Äôm wondering what has changed in recent years, if the facilities are put together, and how current students feel about the mfa program, the school, and it‚Äôs faculty. 

and if you‚Äôre not studying art, what are you studying in grad school at columbia? how do you feel about it? (i might fuck around and study philosophy or literature instead)

i‚Äôm finding it hard to find the actual vibe of the school. it‚Äôs so ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù that genuine critiques and concerns from students are often washed out in online spaces.

tuxn5t,Columbia SEAS vs Berkeley EECS (Computer Science)," Hey ya'll, I'm a prospective student at Columbia for the c/o 2026. Having trouble deciding between Berkeley EECS and Columbia SEAS.

The choice is quite subjective and I'm having trouble weighing them, but here are some of my considerations.

1. I'm not as concerned about the quality of academics, but rather how much time in your day it would consume. Free time is important to me as I hope to network and build cs projects on my own. How much time per week does work take at Columbia, and how much free time is it?
2. The ""College Experience"": A lot on this subreddit complian about ""stress culture"" and ""why am I here"". I don't want to look back 10 years down the road and say college wasn't fun. How much ""fun"" is Columbia in this regard?
3. How theoretical is Columbia's coursework? How pissed off do SEAS students get at unrelated/unpractical problemsets and such?
4. I'm also interested in Startups. While Berkeley may have the edge here, Columbia is in NYC; Is there still a startup precense on campus?

Thanks,

Growing up in LA, I picked up on how to be ‚Äústreet smart‚Äù, but felt largely protected since we heavily rely on cars for transportation here. How is life in NY right now and around the campus? Some have mentioned that they don‚Äôt feel particularly safe in the surrounding area where CUMC is located, so I wanted to hear from students who are living there now.

Overall, I‚Äôm very independent and would love to go out into the city in my free time, but don‚Äôt want to feel held back by fear of traveling alone as a petite single woman.

**Columbia Pros:**

Close to home

Nice research opportunity since I can continue to work with my mentor.

Highly ranked in my major.

**Columbia Cons:**

Maybe too close to home.

Not entirely sure if I'd like to be in the city.

Stress culture from the core.

**Northwestern Pros:**

I love the feel of the campus.

Amazing opportunities offered to explore premed

I can easily change majors since I'm not hindered by a core if I don't like what I'm doing.

Nice distance from home.

Suburb right next to a city so the best of both worlds.

Quarter system so I can take more classes.

**Northwestern Cons:**

Parents are really pressuring me to go to Columbia.

I'm a SEAS students getting my masters. There is a core class that I am taking and after the results of the midterm, I am in a really really bad position.

Although I like Columbia as a university a bit more, I got a lot of benefits at USC. I was awarded their half-tuition merit scholarship (Presidential), a Viterbi Scholarship (Viterbi being the school of engineering) plus a Viterbi Fellowship, which gives me priority for research and study abroad opportunities, $3000 annual stipend for basically anything I need, admissions into the NAE Grand Challenges Scholars Program, an extra, program-specific advisor, and another 10k if I decide to pursue their BS + MS in 5 years program.

Also, just for reference, I would major in Aerospace Engineering at USC and Mech Engineering at Columbia.

Given all these benefits, what would you do? From your experience, do you think that the Ivy prestige and connections are worth giving up all those opportunities at USC? Would I have access to the same opportunities with the same ease at Columbia? Just wanted to hear some opinions and hopefully decide after I visit both campuses.

They recommended that I reach out on any type of forum to see if there are any apartment owners that would be interested in hearing more about our meeting plans and if they‚Äôre interested in hosting for 30 minutes, why not.

I am a second-semester freshman having a ""major"" crisis. I love engineering, and always have, but I am having difficulties figuring out what I want to do within the field of engineering. Currently, I have narrowed it down to Mechanical or operational research with a focus on engineering management. 

I have a love for physics which draws me to meche however, I also have strong leadership abilities and I am enjoying my economics class. The only thing that pushes me away from OR is the computer science requirement. I took E1006 (intro to python) my first semester with no coding experience and it was the worst if I did OR I would need to take another computer science class. 

So I was wondering what other Columbia students' experiences are like in both meche and OR. And how computer science-heavy is OR - engineering management - because I could suffer through one more coding class, but I can not do it for the rest of my undergrad.

ty6dea,What are things you wish you knew before your first year at Columbia? (From an incoming international MA student at TC),"Hi! Some background on me: I'm a 23-year-old from the Philippines, and I'm (hopefully) starting TC'S MA program in Psychology this Fall. I honestly didn't expect to get admitted because the whole month of March passed without me hearing back from them, but I got an acceptance letter yesterday so now my family and I are doing our best to secure funding for my tuition and living expenses.

Preparing to move my life halfway across the world has left me quite overwhelmed to say the least. I'm going to schedule a virtual meet with a current student soon, but I also wanted to get insights from the people on this sub. While I'm lucky to have a good support system that's helping me make the move, there might be things that we overlooked, especially because I'm the first one in my immediate family (and among a lot of my friend circles) who's going abroad for an extended period of time. 

The following are some topics/concerns I was hoping to get some insights on:

* **Cutting costs on everyday expenses** \-- I don't really have a concept of what's considered as ""reasonably priced"" in New York because coming from a country where minimum wage is literally $10 a day, I find everything exorbitantly expensive. I can't do much about the tuition, but maybe you have tips on how to cut the cost of day-to-day living. (For context, I don't come from a rich family. While I live pretty comfortably here in the Philippines, we don't earn anywhere near the amount of money needed to study in an Ivy League and live in New York with ease, so I'll be a semi-broke working-student who's pursuing Every Scholarship Possible For Me to Apply to.) 
* **Assimilating into school culture** \-- Was there anything that surprised you with how people behaved or interacted with each other when you got into Columbia? Secondly, one of my concerns as an international student is that I won't have a support system to help me through my work and studies. Any tips on how you sorta \~found your people\~ in the school? Lastly, are there any unspoken rules or norms that would be better for me to know beforehand? 
* **Maintaining mental and physical health** \-- In terms of balancing your health with your academics and other obligations, what would you do differently now from your first year in Columbia? Are there any possible sources of support within the school community that people might not be aware of? 
* **Maximizing opportunities** \-- The sheer amount of options when it comes to academic, professional and leisurely pursuits is overwhelming my sheltered little third-world brain. A two-year MA program isn't that long if you think about it, so I wanna expedite the process of figuring out what it is I want to do or what the most worthwhile endeavors are. What's your advice on how I can make the most out of my stay? What are experiences that you think you missed out on, and experiences you think I can skip?

If you have any other tips or advice not related to the topics I stated but you think would help me out (whether specific to being a Columbia student or just living in New York in general), I'd really, really appreciate them!

tyx8qb,Columbia vs. Princeton &amp; Stanford,"Disclaimer: Hi! I realize that this post may be slightly annoying since it‚Äôs for an incoming freshman student, but I‚Äôd really appreciate any insight you guys might have on Columbia. Thank you so much and sorry for the inconvenience! 

I‚Äôve recently been accepted to Columbia, Princeton, and Stanford, and am having trouble deciding between the three schools (It‚Äôs the most fortunate problem I‚Äôll probably ever have, and I‚Äôm still in disbelief right now). I‚Äôm a humanities/artsy person who‚Äôs planning to major in history/urban studies/architecture/art history, but in general, I‚Äôm still pretty undecided. I‚Äôm also thinking of a career possibly in law, architecture, public service, or some creative field, but I‚Äôll definitely attend grad school in some way in the future.

Cost of attendance is the same for all three schools, so money isn‚Äôt really a deciding factor. I definitely prefer suburban/urban colleges though, so it seems that Columbia and NYC would be a great fit for me. 

I wanted to ask you all which college you would choose given my position, and if you had any input on what Columbia is like? I absolutely love Columbia, so it would be amazing to hear from you about Columbia‚Äôs student culture, campus life, stress level, or any other information you might have. For example, I heard gaining internships and opportunities in NYC is unparalleled at Columbia compared to Princeton and Stanford, but I also heard that teaching here is mostly done by TAs compared with the undergraduate-focused nature of Princeton. 

I‚Äôve been racking my brains at this decision for the past week, so any help would be a godsend.

tz9ssp,Barnard or Brown?,"Hi all!

I decided to post here instead of on the Barnard-specific subreddit because this has significantly more members. 

I got into Barnard as a Scholar of Distinction (I think it is around 5ish in the incoming class), which has many interesting benefits such as two years of paid research (can be in any form) under the guidance of a mentor of my choice on top of other things.

I also got into Brown. I was deferred ED but got in RD, so I am not bound by anything. No program similar to the Barnard one exists - there is funding for research projects (which is competitive to obtain), but nothing as all-encompassing as the Barnard Scholars program.

Now, my parents are suggesting Brown simply because it is more selective (5% vs 8%) and has a ‚Äú‚Äùbetter reputation‚Äù‚Äù. They are also concerned about Barnard‚Äôs alumni network. Now, everyone else is suggesting Barnard. I am truly split.

u0mpja,Masks are required again,"Dear Colleagues,¬†

We write to update you on the COVID-19 status in New York City and where we are in terms of public health measures at the University. Based on the current situation and in an abundance of caution we will require wearing of non-cloth masks in classrooms beginning Monday morning April 11, 2022. This mandatory masking policy applies to classrooms only and is expected to remain in place for the few remaining weeks of our spring semester.¬† As has been our policy all year, instructors have the option to¬† remove their masks while teaching.¬† Current policies on masking in all other settings continue unchanged.

We remain in low-risk or green status based on Columbia‚Äôs COVID-19 monitoring plan and so does New York City based on its designated risk levels. Over the past few weeks there has been an uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases in New York City and not surprisingly in the percent positivity in our own surveillance testing program. Reassuringly, this has not been associated as of yet with a commensurate increase in hospitalizations in New York City, an important and more reliable metric of the status of the pandemic.¬†¬†

Continued caution in certain situations remains extremely important, particularly in indoor social settings when the vaccination status of attendees is unknown or uncertain. Being up-to-date in terms of COVID-19 vaccination status ‚Äì i.e., to get all doses of the vaccines (primary and booster doses) as recommended by the CDC ‚Äì is critically important. Lastly, the availability of effective COVID-19 treatments for those with COVID-19 and at risk of complications should also be noted.¬†

u0rfcu,History seminar classes as a SEAS student doing history minor.,"I'm a engineering student doing a minor in history. I only have 1 class left to complete the requirements, and was considering taking a 3000 level history class since all my other history classes so far have been lecture style. I was wondering if anyone here has had experience either taking a seminar class as a history minor or has had an engineering student in their seminar class? I don't want to take a seat away from a history major nor do I want to be a drag on the classes, but I also have no idea what to expect or what the requirements look like.

If it changes anything, I'm pretty serious about history, and the 3000 level classes seem like a good introduction to going deeper into sources and the methodology of historical research. I am, however, a rather notoriously slow writer. If anyone has any class recommendations or professor recommendations as well I would gladly heard them!",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/u0rfcu/history_seminar_classes_as_a_seas_student_doing/,axoxia,1,2022-04-10 17:24:52,0,/r/columbia/comments/u0rfcu/history_seminar_classes_as_a_seas_student_doing/

My advisor is wonderful and supportive, but I've concretely set on a different major as I was exploring different options during my gap year. I thought if I'm sure I'll go with a new major, why not change my advisor to that new department if I'll have to anyways when I declare major when I'm sophomore?

1. Identify images of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers and military equipment.
2. Collect images featured in Russian propaganda.¬†

The    individuals volunteering to sort images of soldiers and military    equipment will be provided an easy crash course by the verification team    lead (me). Here is an example of the material that will be covered in    the crash course: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7Xa-r5yXo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7Xa-r5yXo).

The    atrocities committed by Russian forces every day are testament to the    need for efficient and reliable real-time tracking of Russian troop    movements for the safety of Ukrainian civilians. Please help by  donating   some of your time. Even as little as a couple hours would be  helpful.

I received a job offer in another state, which means I have to give up my room. :(

Anyway, the apartment is on 109th, and  is in between Amsterdam &amp; Columbus. If you take the room, I‚Äôd also be willing to give you my mattress &amp; dresser for free.

The setup is a 3 bedroom apartment, with two of the rooms already being occupied. The two dudes in the room are in their early 20s. There is also a living room already filled with furniture. There‚Äôs also a cat &amp; a dog, whom are both very cute.

Also, the apartment is very 420 friendly, so if you‚Äôre okay with that, this might be the perfect setup for you.

I‚Äôm looking to get $1100 per month for the room.

The room will be available starting May 1st, and will be available until the end of December. I‚Äôd also be willing to move now, if you needed it for April.

If this sounds like something you, or someone else you know would want - please reach out via DM, and I can certainly give a Facetime tour of the room, or at least send pictures.

The time has come for me to say that the next academic year will be my last as president. I have informed the Trustees that I will step down on June 30, 2023.  

I cannot begin to express what it has meant to me to serve in this role for this magnificent University for over two decades. Certainly, it has been a defining experience of my life. It has also been an especially high pleasure to do so at the beginning of the new century and in a period of rising intellectual excellence across the institution. No university in the world is more committed to the life of the mind or possessed of the will to bring knowledge and ideas to the service of humanity. Columbia is remarkably agile, creative, fresh, and experimental. I am certain that the conditions are present for an even more brilliant future in the decades ahead. And I will leave confident that our potential and aspirations will be realized.  

For myself, I entered academic life nearly 50 years ago believing that being a professor is a noble calling, and, so, I am thrilled to return to that mission full-time. I am profoundly grateful to everyone for their partnership and friendship, but I am especially thankful to my wife, Jean, whose contributions within and through Columbia have been many, whose life as an artist has been made at times somewhat more difficult by mine, and whose very existence makes me a better person.

u3jh5q,[Email Announcement] CU President Lee C. Bollinger Stepping Down in 2023,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

The time has come for me to say that the next academic year will be my last as president. I have informed the Trustees that I will step down on June 30, 2023.

I cannot begin to express what it has meant to me to serve in this role for this magnificent University for over two decades. Certainly, it has been a defining experience of my life. It has also been an especially high pleasure to do so at the beginning of the new century and in a period of rising intellectual excellence across the institution. No university in the world is more committed to the life of the mind or possessed of the will to bring knowledge and ideas to the service of humanity.

u4qllt,Asking professor to change course schedule?,"*TL;DR*: If a seminar I very much want to take has a time conflict with a major requirement, would it be reasonable to ask the seminar professor if he could change the class time? This professor teaches another class besides the seminar, so, would it be a good idea if I politely ask them if they could switch the time of their two classes?

*More context*: I'm a rising senior and the required class is only offered in the fall, so next semester is my only chance to take it. The seminar is a graduate seminar with a topic of great interest in the field that I want to do graduate studies.

Being a small graduate seminar, I assume, allows some flexibility for change, and I've known the professor well from previous classes, which doesn't pose a challenge to ask. On the other hand, graduate seminars already have extra restrictions for undergraduate students to enroll in, changing their time to accommodate an undergrad seems like an impossibility. Besides, as registration period is just around the corner, I assume changing would be difficult.",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/u4qllt/asking_professor_to_change_course_schedule/,CameraInteresting26,1,2022-04-16 01:11:21,0,/r/columbia/comments/u4qllt/asking_professor_to_change_course_schedule/

I'm currently in a lab that I expect to be doing part-time work in over the next year while I apply to medical school. Few issues here:

* I don't yet know how much I'm going to be paid for this work; my PI's had a lot of things taking her time as of recent, but she says she'll give me more info soon. (I hope.)
* I'm trying to line up another part-time job in another health-adjacent field, but that's something I've only recently started doing as I was pretty occupied with MCAT stuff for a while (at least, that's my best excuse). I'm hoping a professor I reached out to comes through for me, but if he's unable to find anything for me from his own network, then there's another thing to worry about.
* Without any solid source of income or sure employment for the next 3 months, it's hard to do any real apartment hunting.
* Also, this is the first time I've done any ""apartment hunting."" I went to the workshop that student council was advertising, and I came away with it with a lot of facts and a lot of confusion.
* This is less a logistics one, but... I'm not super confident in my ability to do the jobs I'm trying to do. My work in my current lab's been slow-going and I have a constant anxiety that I'm under-performing and going to be fired. Meanwhile, I have limited experience under my belt for the other part-time job I'm looking for; it's the fact that the ""limited experience"" went well enough for me that I'm even pursuing said part-time job.

u81hsl,Question about General Studies,"Hi all, 

After graduating high school last year, I took a gap year and spent it all pretty much abroad (volunteering, traveling, etc.). I have been fortunate enough to receive pleanty admissions offers this year (probably more than I deserve). However, I see no harm in applying for GS as the deadline in May 15 and well simply put, it intruiges me. 

It appears like a common trend each year for someone in this sub to voice their GS concerns so I will try to be less clich√©. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Being an 18 y/o student, would I feel out of place at GS?

u8pcwz,COMS 1002: How much does section matter?,"Hello! I'm planning to take COMS 1002 in the fall, and I have a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I am interested in taking the Art ""Context"" of the course, but the description is pretty vague on details. Has anyone taken the Art version of the course? My other options are Economics and Social Science. Does the material vary significantly depending on what version you take? The section I'm looking at is called COMS 1002: Art or Econ, so I'm guessing they can't be that different.
2. I'm assuming that it's required to take COMS 1012 concurrently with COMS 1002. However, would it be possible to take a section in a different Context? I'm facing a potential conflict, so I'm wondering if it'd be okay if the versions didn't match up. 
3. Seeing as COMS 1012 is a 0 credit class, is attendance mandatory?

Also, if anyone has had Lindsay Piechnik or Akash Sengupta for Calc I, I'd love to hear about your experiences. Assuming the sections have to match, I can either take COMS Soc Sci and Piechnik, or COMS Art and Sengupta.

uan0eg,"Columbia administration | Academic support | Core curriculum (prospective undergrad student, co2026)","I am very stuck on which college to pick but leaning towards choosing Columbia over Yale. I plan to study computer science at SEAS with career interests in DS/Quant/SWE.

From general reading, I have seen a lot of complaints about the administration at Columbia, as well as there being less academic support when compared to other schools like Yale. For example, professors being less approachable, the grad protests, etc. Are these things issues, or made to seem worse than they actually are?

Also, I am not a huge fan of the core, and honestly am not tryna read 60 books in a year (probably haven't read 60 books in my whole life, lol). However, I have heard that SEAS isn't that bad regarding the core requirements.

Here are some of the pros and cons I currently have:

&amp;#x200B;

**Columbia**

Pros:

\-bs/ms express program 4-5 yrs and can do CS bs in SEAS and then ORFE/CS/DS ms or maybe ms in stats not sure

\-good location for career stuff (interviews, internships, etc)

\-Scholars Program CUSP (tho I've heard it doesn't rlly make a difference)

\-Slightly stronger STEM programs

\-guaranteed 4 yrs housing

Cons:

\-Core Curriculum (tho maybe not that bad cuz I'm in SEAS)

\-Campus isn't the best, but ig being in New York balances that out

\-Administration/student support, comparatively worse?

\-slightly less fun undergrad experience

&amp;#x200B;

**Yale**

Pros:

\-Residential Colleges

\-Great undergrad experience

\-Better campus

\-Better grad school placement?

\-Tighter knit alumni network

\-slightly more flexible curriculum? 

Cons:

\-bs/ms program limited to 4 yrs and same major (however ig I could always do a 1.5 yr ms program at like Stanford, so not too different compared to the 5 yr bs/ms at Columbia)

\-Class shopping (could be difficult to get the classes I want)

\-Housing Lottery (might not get housing junior year)

\-Slightly weaker Stem program

\-maybe location, idk? (I've heard new havens not the best, tho i think id be fine)

Maybe in ihouse I'd be able to meet people who are up to other interesting things as well and go to other schools.

uho4p5,What club or sororities should I join next school year?,"After signing up for 20+ club newsletters at club day this past fall semester, I ended up being overwhelmed with school work and actually putting in some effort in participating in a few clubs‚Äîwith none of them really intriguing me. Could be because I wasn‚Äôt a board member or leader in any of them, or maybe I just couldn‚Äôt give them a chance, or could be because I ended up overwhelming myself with all the club newsletters I signed myself up for. Could any of those reasons be the case? 

I‚Äôm a first-year CS major in SEAS, and decided to join CSI and tried a bit of Formula 1, but it just felt more work heavy than team-bonding to me. I tried Women in CS and Society of Women Engineers, but there were too little meet up events, with no deep connections formed. 

Most people recommend using clubs as a way to make friends, and I didn‚Äôt really get to make any real friends from any of the clubs just because I wasn‚Äôt interested in them enough to attend meetings by the end of fall semester. I really want to change that next year by joining clubs that not only relate to my major, but also have friendly and fun environments with cool people. I would never imagine myself literally paying to make friends or ‚Äúsisters‚Äù by joining a sorority, but right now that seems to be the last resort and an alright option. Plus from what I‚Äôve briefly seen, the girls in the sororities appear to be close and hang out with each other often. I‚Äôm open to joining a sports team even though I‚Äôm not the best or most athletic person.

ukvayv,UMich vs Barnard,"(Barnard sub is tiny and I have to make a decision soon)

I‚Äôm a junior international transfer doing Econ. I‚Äôm full pay at both, so Michigan is $70k/year and BC is $80k/year. I‚Äôm interested in IB. Never applied to Columbia because it‚Äôs very similar to the school I‚Äôm currently trying to leave, and very much into the idea of a small womens college in an urban setting, but not sure if a Barnard degree is worth $160k over a Michigan degree for $140k.

I‚Äôm not in Ross at Michigan, and I understand that while Econ at Michigan is decently well respected and places reasonably well, the Barnard ‚Äò21 employment report lists several graduates at GS, JPM, and several other banks from Citi to Lazard, while I don‚Äôt have any of the same data for Michigan LSA. Additionally, I understand that Columbia and BC share student organisations, so I can apply to the Lion Fund, etc.

My friend at Barnard is at GS this summer and has very good things to say about the degree of interest displayed by BBs in Barnard, and I‚Äôve heard that recruiters at Columbia frequently speak to Barnard kids as well. Is this true, and if anyone has any experience with this I‚Äôd appreciate some input.",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/ukvayv/umich_vs_barnard/,martythemartell,1,2022-05-08 01:54:57,0,/r/columbia/comments/ukvayv/umich_vs_barnard/

un0ato,Kinda regretting choosing Columbia...,"I feel that every time I read things online, Columbia students are complaining about the school: poor administration, stress culture, lack of school spirit, protests, etc. Obviously this may be common to alot of schools, but Yale was the other school I was considering and people seemed to love everything there. While Columbia students have personally recommended people to not attend the school? And the only real benefit ive heard is that its in NYC?

Is it really as bad as people make it seem, or are the responses just biased?

Im not sure what to make of it - obviously its too late to change now. But I feel I should be more excited about my college choice.

Sorry if i sound ungrateful, however, I really don't want to feel Ive made the wrong decision just because a few people on the internet expressed concerns about Columbia.

unx7a9,"Columbia is the first the first place in my life I‚Äôve genuinely felt a sense of belonging, and I love it here‚Äîa counter-post to all the people asking if we are a miserable school.","I‚Äôve seen too many post recently of people asking if everyone here has a negative reason or if the school is miserable, etc etc. 

I just want to say that Columbia has been the best experience of my life so far. I grew up mixed race between two almost opposite environments, I‚Äôve never felt like I belong anymore, I‚Äôve been a victim of racism for both my halves, and I‚Äôve always felt unable to communicate with people for thinking is such unorthodox ways. 

I transferred from a pre-dominantly white school where I felt there was a weird mix of hyper PC culture and thinly veiled sort of new-age racism, where you basically get tokenized or percieved as exotic, cuz people think it‚Äôs ‚Äúcool‚Äù to be friends with someone from a unique background. 

At Columbia I‚Äôve found people who appreciate the way I think, who get me, and misfits who like me just love knowledge and the occasional city escape. Everything about the whole experience is intellectually stimulating. 

This is not to say the school doesn‚Äôt have its problems. I think the administration is awful, the works load for some classes (not mine but like Advanced Program for ex) is a form of abuse, it‚Äôs dummy expensive, gentrification is disgusting, and they need to treat TAs better. With that said I do think the criticism is applicable to most schools and the criticism is emboldened here by peoples personal experiences. 

I think that if you accept the issues of Columbia for what they are and truly focus on the good aspects, you will find an absolutely amazing experiencing that will literally change your life as it has for mine. I love Columbia and how it‚Äôs made me feel at home for once in my life. To those of you who have had a bad experience, all I can say is I‚Äôm sorry that was the case, but I encourage you not to give up and to make a genuine effort to find ways feel at home/enjoy yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/unx7a9/columbia_is_the_first_the_first_place_in_my_life/,Suntzie,1,2022-05-12 05:31:12,0,/r/columbia/comments/unx7a9/columbia_is_the_first_the_first_place_in_my_life/

up91i4,"All the best, Columbia!","Hi everybody!  It's nice to meet you all, and I hope everybody here is doing really well.

I currently go to another school, but I got into Columbia last year as a transfer student and was really excited and happy.  I really, really wanted to come here because it was one of my favorite schools, but I spoke with an advisor here before I committed and unfortunately found out that since I have to take all the classes in the Core Curriculum, and I'd have to redo a lot of the classes for one of my majors, I unfortunately wouldn't be able to double major like I hoped to.

I felt really bad about turning Columbia down because I loved this community so much, was excited about the Core classes, felt like you all were a really good fit, but I did it anyway in hopes of pursuing a double major, and the place I chose instead has unfortunately been really bad for me.  I decided to apply again as a transfer this year hoping that I can correct my mistake, but I was unfortunately rejected yesterday, and if I'm being honest with you all, I'm really disappointed.  I know it's wrong for me to feel that way, and it's so selfish and ungrateful of me when a lot of people are hoping to be in the position I am right now.  

However, I honestly just feel really lost, and I was wondering if any of you all might have any advice for me in my situation, especially if anyone was in a situation like this before and managed to find a way to attend in the future. 

For those of you who got in as a transfer yesterday, I am extremely happy for everybody who got in, and I'm really excited to hear what you all are going to accomplish.  I'm really, really sorry I won't be joining you all, and I really wish I could, but I'm so excited for you all and hope you all have an incredible time here.

And thank you everybody for reading this and for taking the time.  It means a lot, and I really wish you all the very best.  Good luck with your final exams if you have any right now!

upv2vj,Looking for an alum from the Class of 1964,"Hi all,

I'm doing some research for an upcoming podcast series about the history of college admissions. I'm interested in an event known as ""Dudley's Folly""‚Äî the year (1960) that David Dudley, the head of admissions at Columbia College, admitted a class of students based almost entirely on grades and test scores‚Äî in other words, without taking into account the sort of 'well rounded class' considerations that dominate most college admissions.

The result was that the class of 1964 was, in a number of important ways, the least diverse in Columbia's modern history.

I'd love to hear from anyone who knows anything about this story, but particularly from anyone who was in that class, or at Columbia at the same time. Obviously, that's an older crowd at this point, but they're certainly out there, and certainly reachable somehow.

If you're uncomfortable commenting here, for whatever reason, please feel free to PM me.

upvvml,How to deal with noisy neighbors in a civil way?,"Hi all, I've been dealing with a couple that lives above me, and they make excessive noise after hours pretty often. My partner and I try to put up with the noise as much as possible, but there are times where it's just too much. I have cluster migraines, and one of the biggest triggers is a lack of sleep. There are countless times where I've been unable to sleep because of the noise, and consequently I have to pay the price the next day. I have had to miss classes and cancel plans with my friends because of frequent migraines, in part caused by lack of sleep from the excessive disturbances. I've lived in apartments pretty much my entire life, so I don't consider myself to be sensitive to sound (with the exception of during the migraines). 

I've tried communicating with them in the past, but there's been little progress. We try to put up with the noise as much as possible until quiet hours, but after that it's just too much. Unlike them, I do not wish to stay up late at night (i.e. 4 am) and sleep all day. I don't want to ask them anymore because we're worried about confrontation (they get pretty rude and nasty, even when we ask nicely), so we've resorted to asking public safety to intervene or filing noise complaints with the police reports. I'm not sure what else we could do. I've contemplated trying to get a housing accommodation with disability services, but I don't think there's anything I could ask for. I already live on campus in my own apartment.

I'm so sick of this drama. I don't think I've asked for much. Literally all I've asked for is for them to be mindful of noise late at night (so during quiet hours, when they are actually supposed to be quiet anyways) and not to have people over that late if it's disturbing us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/upvvml/how_to_deal_with_noisy_neighbors_in_a_civil_way/,coffee_addict517,1,2022-05-14 22:08:11,0,/r/columbia/comments/upvvml/how_to_deal_with_noisy_neighbors_in_a_civil_way/

uq547z,A Message for all my (Brothers/sisters/persons) who are premed,"Dear fellow CU premeds,

&amp;#x200B;

1. Let's do our best not to embody r/premed on campus. There are people who are stressing and crying over their grades, and talking about your B+ and being upset about it makes the person who struggled for a C feel like absolute shit. Only talk about grades to people you know won't feel bad about it. When in doubt, ask if they feel comfortable talking about it. 
2. For those who didn't get the grades you want, keep your head up and learn from your mistakes. Medical schools like stories. If yours is that you had to retake gen chem or orgo or whatever, good. It will show redemption. It will show a story. Medical schools like people who haven't had everything given to them, which will also make you look unique coming from an ivy league school where that's quite common. You will become a doctor if you want it badly enough. The fact that you're here suggests that you are most definitely capable. I failed one of my midterms and pulled it all the way back at the end of the semester, and I'm by no means the brightest bulb in the tool shed lmao. This can be done for a course gpa, or for an overall gpa. YOU GOT THIS. 
3. Reach out to people if you're struggling. I love CU, but the coursework can be a mental health whirlpool sometimes. Ask for help. There are *free* therapy sessions for students (free with your 80k tuition) [https://www.health.columbia.edu/content/counseling-and-psychological-services](https://www.health.columbia.edu/content/counseling-and-psychological-services) Don't forget that your mental health is far more important than your grades. 
4. Healthy premeds make healthy med students. Healthy med students make healthy doctors. Healthy doctors make healthy patients. Your health matters. Your mental health matters.

uqdmy1,Graduate Student Housing -- 100 Morningside Drive,"My fiancee is starting at Columbia this Fall, and we secured a 1BR apartment at 100 Morningside Drive.

Any general impressions would be greatly appreciated, and I'm also more than happy to direct message anyone with knowledge of the apartment. 

Otherwise, a few more specific questions: 
* How flexible or standardized are the furnishings in the apartment? There was only furnished 1BRs available during our bidding process, but we already own our own furniture. 
* How is Columbia's grad housing internet? I'd be happy to pay for a separate ISP to get faster/more stable internet -- is that possible? 
* How easy is it for graduate students to move apartments in future years through Columbia if an issue arises with the first one?

So what exactly happens on June 22?  Is it like a free-for-all/first-come-first-serve where I just go onto the housing website and select an available unit? Or do I still have to wait for an email with an offer?

And do students generally get off the waitlist if they submitted their application before the housing waitlist even opened?

utsn7l,should I apply again or move on?,"heyyy. I hope y‚Äôall are doing well. I‚Äôll preface this by saying that Columbia is probably as close to a dream school as a university could get for me. I love the core. Manhattan. The cs program. The beautiful campus. The students and the culture. Even just the general aesthetic of this place LMAO. I applied freshman year to Columbia and was rejected. I applied again this year and was rejected once again. 

By some miracle though, I got into UPenn, which is an amazing school I definitely overlooked but that I‚Äôm also growing to like. I want to pull the trigger and commit, but I keep on going back and forth on whether I want to try and shoot my shot at Columbia again as a Junior transfer. My question would be a) whether going to Penn will kill any chances of me going to Columbia (and by extension whether there are any double transfers on campus) and b) whether I‚Äôd be making a mistake by rejecting Penn and gunning for Columbia again from my current school. 

Honestly I feel like i already know that b) is probably an extremely dumb move, but my heart still wants to take the risk and try again. I just really don‚Äôt know what to do :/. I know grad school is probably not for me so this is like my last chance ever to attend this wonderful place.

uu6xya,How does the PhD funding work?,"Hi there! I am thinking about obtaining a PhD, ideally in communications, journalism or advertising/marketing. I got my bachelors in communications, specializing in advertising and public relations. I know funding is limited for non-STEM majors, but I am finding out that I would like to be a leader in the communications, media and advertising field. 

I did a bit of research on Columbia's page with regards to the PhD program, but they only offer 5-years of funding, and it looks like this is a 6 or 7-year program. Is that right to say?

So would it be correct that I would live on a stipend and free tuition for the first 5-years, but any years after that, would be on me to cover the remaining tuition? Is that how most PhD programs go, or just Columbia's by nature?

uws0sp,Josef Sorett Appointed Dean of Columbia College,"Email sent to CC students just now.

&gt;  Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:
&gt; 
&gt; I am delighted to announce that I have appointed Josef Sorett to serve as the next Dean of Columbia College and Vice President of Undergraduate Education, effective July 1, 2022.
&gt; 
&gt; Professor Sorett, who first came to Columbia in 2009, is a brilliant scholar, a beloved teacher, and a dedicated administrator. He is currently Professor of Religion and African American and African Diaspora Studies, Chair of the Department of Religion, and Director of the Center on African-American Religion, Sexual Politics and Social Justice. Josef received his BS in Health and Exercise Science from Oral Roberts University, his MDiv in Religion and Literature from Boston University, and his PhD in African American Studies from Harvard University.
&gt; 
&gt; Josef‚Äôs scholarship explores the vital and complex role that religion has played in shaping the cultures of Black communities and movements in this country. His research straddles the disciplines of history, literature, religion, art, and music. His first book, Spirit in the Dark: A Religious History of Racial Aesthetics, examines the influence of religion on debates about Black art and culture in the 20th century. His latest work, The Sexual Politics of Black Churches, investigates the politics of sexuality within Black churches and the communities they serve. Josef‚Äôs interests extend across time periods and regions, analyzing conversations about marriage equality in the present alongside debates about the Black Arts movement of the 1960s.
&gt; 
&gt; Josef‚Äôs courses, including those in the Core Curriculum, African American Studies, and gospel music, are immensely popular. In his classrooms, students grapple with profound questions about culture, identity, and race. They are challenged to think freely and critically about the people and ideas that have shaped our world. For his dynamic and inclusive approach to pedagogy, and based on heartfelt and enthusiastic nominations from students and peers, Josef received the Presidential Award for Outstanding Teaching at this year‚Äôs Commencement.
&gt; 
&gt; Above and beyond his work as Chair of the Department of Religion and as the Founding Director of the Center on African-American Religion, Sexual Politics and Social Justice, Josef‚Äôs leadership in critical University administrative initiatives has been considerable, most notably as Chair of the Inclusive Public Safety Advisory Committee, an important part of the University‚Äôs ongoing efforts to address anti-Black racism, and as a member of the Task Force on the Relationship of the Arts &amp; Sciences and the College.
&gt; 
&gt; Josef is a consummate Columbian, who brings to this position a deep commitment to the unique and special role of the Core Curriculum in our undergraduate education and to ensuring our students have the best possible experience, inside and outside of the classroom, at the College.
&gt; 
&gt; I extend my thanks to the members of the search committee for their careful and thorough work. And, on behalf of the entire Columbia community, I offer Jim Valentini our collective gratitude for his leadership over the last decade.
&gt; 
&gt; Please join me in congratulating Josef Sorett on this well-deserved appointment.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; 
&gt; Lee C. Bollinger",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/uws0sp/josef_sorett_appointed_dean_of_columbia_college/,drakilon,1,2022-05-24 10:23:47,0,/r/columbia/comments/uws0sp/josef_sorett_appointed_dean_of_columbia_college/

uyms7e,Transferring into environmental engineering,"Hi! I'm a Barnard sustainable development major (rising sophomore), but I want to major in environmental engineering. Apparently, you cannot take on a SEAS major through Barnard, unless you do a 4+1 pathway which I do not want to do for academic, personal interest, and financial reasons.

I currently have a 4.0, and I have set up my schedule to fulfill all of the SEAS freshman/sophomore technical requirements by the end of my sophomore year. I'm also planning on taking the SAT in June, since I wasn't able to when applying regularly because of COVID.

Does anyone have any advice on who I should talk to/what I should do? I know I have to apply as an external transfer because Barnard is an affiliate school, but I imagine that I can't be the first person to wants to switch into an engineering degree. If anyone on here has been through a process like this, your advice/feedback would be much appreciated! Even if you haven't, but have some ideas on what to do, haha

CVN student here doing my masters. In my first year, I've felt that one major experience that I've lacked is the experience of being able to connect and network with other students, given the distance learning, as that experience has been minimal within my courses as well.

Recently in one of my courses we had get-to-know-each-other sessions where three students are put in one Zoom room for a period of time each week and I think it would be cool to bring into the bigger Columbia community for us CVN students to connect with each other. I think it was also great since it personalizes the experiences as well (with having a few people to meet each week in a random grouping compared to the whole network in a Zoom room chatting at once).

Although this is mainly targeted towards CVN students, if you're currently studying on campus, would love to get to know you as well! Would be great to get some people to know and hang out with when coming over to New York for either taking courses or for graduation!

If you're interested in this networking, I've made a discord at [https://discord.gg/eKbNWERy](https://discord.gg/eKbNWERy)/DM me/comment below; happy to connect!

v1up7l,Georgia Tech CS vs Columbia GS CS (Sophomore transfer) (Is there any undergrad who works with professor Elias Bareinboim),"Hello, I have been admitted as a transfer to Georgia Tech CS and Columbia GS CS as a sophomore transfer. May I ask you some questions about Columbia CS and GS?

1. Is there any undergraduate student who works with professor Elias Bareinboim? I am really interested in causality in Machine Learning and I really want to work with professor Bareinboim. Or is there any undergraduate student who works with professor Carl Vondrick? His researches are very intriguing as well. Is it very hard to work with these professors as undergraduate?
2. How is the computer science class size at Columbia? I have heard that the class size can be quite large even though Columbia is a private school. Do you have a hard time getting to know with professors due to the size of classes and long waiting for office hours?
3. Can you take graduate classes in CS, Math and Statistics as undergrad? Also, there's no declaration requirements or restrictions like Berkeley when declaring cs/math/statistics, right?
4. Finally, is there a lot of disadvantage for being a GS student? I was wondering why so many people describe themselves as CC/SEAS/Bernard/GS student instead of Columbia Uni student. It seems there are clear divide within the school... Is the atmosphere hostile to one another?

I am an international student and I am planning to apply for ML phd programs in America. Money is not an issue for me.

v1xcgs,Can I finish computer science major requirements in 2 years?,"Hi all,

I was recently admitted to Columbia as a junior transfer! I'm bringing 60 points with me from my previous institution, where I studied finance. Given that Columbia does not have an undergraduate business program, I won't be able to continue my study of finance. I am considering economics (44 points), computer science (40-47 points), and history (30 points) as alternatives. 

Regardless of the major I choose, I need to be able to graduate in two years and will be unable to take courses nexts summer. I was fortunate enough to effectively secure a dream full-time position which would begin in June of 2024. Because of the fact that I **really** want this job I would be hard-pressed to push graduation beyond this date, and therefore need to graduate within two years.

For those who have experience within these areas of study, is it at all possible to graduate within two years? For additional color, to complete the core, I'll need to take three semesters of language, one global core class, Literature, Art, Music, and UW (27 credits total).

Also, any additional suggestions are welcome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/v1xcgs/can_i_finish_computer_science_major_requirements/,spccoop,1,2022-05-31 14:53:41,0,/r/columbia/comments/v1xcgs/can_i_finish_computer_science_major_requirements/

Columbia housing have viewing appointments but only in person! (too sad about that). Also my assigned roommates are keeping their info private on the housing portal, so I couldn‚Äôt reach out to them. 

If anyone has pictures/reviews/have lived/is living there would you please share either here or message me?

Wanted to let you know that PRET, (coffee place across the st from main entrance to CU,) offers a subscription service for coffee that's $30/month for 5 coffees per day. Including lattes, cold brew, etc. You can even add syrup. Coffee in NYC is so expensive. Joe Coffee is like 7 dollars for a latte on campus and that's kinda ridiculous. I have an espresso machine at home, and I can tell you that this is almost as economical as making your own coffee if you drink around 2 cups p/day.

1. How many classes do you typically take in a semester? 

2. Is it overzealous to take these classes together in a semester (2 classes + labs per a given semester): Chemistry I &amp; Physics I, Chemistry II &amp; Physics II, Biology I &amp; OChem I, Biology II &amp; OChem II? (Ignore BioChem, that‚Äôs going to be taken over a summer).**

3. Did you find any of the following Core classes objectively time-consuming/stressful, or is it all perspective: LitHum, CC, ArtHum, or MusicHum?

4. How many ECs do you manage during the school year? 

5. Would anyone be willing to take a look at my four year plan and quickly critique it? I‚Äôve made two lmao. 

6. Has anyone taken the French placement exam? Do you remember the format? Do you need to essentially be a native speaker to test out of the foreign language requirement, or is being around an Advanced level good enough?

7. Has anyone majored in Medical Humanities? How is the workload‚Äîesp. in something like Intro to ICLS? 

8. Do you regret doing premed at Columbia, or do you feel like it would be similarly difficult at any top school (e.g. other Ivies, NYU, MIT, Stanford, Duke, etc.)

** I have experience in Physics and Bio. Took honors and AP versions of both. Did well in all 4. Had a teacher who did a great job‚ÄîI think‚Äîestablishing the foundation of Physics. I also feel like Bio is the least difficult of the prereqs, but ik Columbia likes to be difficult and different.

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/columbia) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking. Also, since some courses depend on the professor, you can filter the reviews by professors and it will show you the average ratings for each professor.
Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.  (to leave a review, just search your course and you can submit a review at the bottom of the page)


Also, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this. And if anyone is interested in writing an article about this dm me!

Find alumni (or anyone) in companies/teams you want to work for. Slide into their DMs expressing your passion for their field. Ask for a quick phone call or coffee chat. Ask good questions about their work/journey/experiences. Ask a couple deep questions about how their field links to current affairs. Ask if they can connect you to someone else on the team.

v9pt4a,LitHum format,"Hi!

I'm a rising senior considering applying to CC/SEAS this fall (my question isnt really an admissions one so i hope this is fine to post here).

I wanted to ask what LitHum is like in terms of assignments and finals to see if I'd like taking it. (My profile is a better fit for CC so im considering applying there and then transferring to SEAS after 1st year).
 I like literature, and I got an A* on IGCSE Lit (probably equivalent to standard US high school lit) but I absolutely hated the finals. We'd have to do 2 ~800 word essays in 80 minutes which always felt way too less for me lol. Is LitHum anything like that?

vaakba,How does the full-ride tuition scholarship work at Columbia University?,"I read on the website, and did my own research, indicating that for students making less then $150,000/yearly, that student would receive a full-ride scholarship to their tuition and costs.

So, given this is Columbia University, what's the catch?

How much is the scholarship covering? Is it truly 100%? What other costs am I responsible for that I am not thinking about or taking into account? 

Is it only for undergraduate students pursuing a bachelor's degree? What if I already have a bachelor's degree from another college, but wanted to go back for another, secondary bachelor's degree?

Is there a full-ride scholarship to graduate school for Columbia? 

If this is indeed true, and it's a full-ride, then I guess the hardest part of the application is the acceptance rate, and getting to be one of the few that get to go to Columbia University! Is this true?

vafo3k,Columbia GS CS vs UC Berkeley CS,"Hi, got into both Columbia GS and UC Berkeley as a community college transfer and will be majoring in Computer science. Already got an apartment and chose classes at Berkeley for Fall already 

About me: age 23. From a poor family, first-gen. Older brothers dropped out of high school. Sold an e-commerce and software business last year. And sold small media businesses and 2 B2B iOS apps prior to that. Currently running a media/data biz and personal investment biz. 

Goals: Might do an MBA later or MS in Management at either Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Columbia, Oxford, or Cambridge. I will continue running the main biz and personal investment biz after graduating. I will likely move to a lower tax area which will save 400 -1mil in taxes after graduating

Berkeley: Graduate in 1-1.5 years (7 classes needed to graduate); Can spend more focused time on doing things I really like. Less likely I will lose momentum
Cost: ~$50k in-state
An hour away from home
My younger sibling will be a freshman and live with me rent-free. Substantially lowering their cost and easing their transition.

Columbia: Graduate in 2.5-3 years. A lot more classes are needed. I will probably lose momentum/ get distracted and start applying for internships
Cost: 3 yr cost ~$190k
Pros:
Prestige factor 
Smaller student body
Living in NYC would be pretty cool
Any other pros that I‚Äôm not thinking of?

Is Columba (mainly prestige factor) worth 2 years of my life? 20% of the time in my 20s? I could spend that time fully focused on working and do an MBA/MS later if I want. 70% of strangers I talk to say Columbia but they don‚Äôt really know me nor my situation. I don‚Äôt want to tell everyone I ask about my situation. 

If there is anything you‚Äôd like me to expand on let me know. Any thoughts/advice would be appreciated. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/vafo3k/columbia_gs_cs_vs_uc_berkeley_cs/,xRockstar__,1,2022-06-12 02:08:03,0,/r/columbia/comments/vafo3k/columbia_gs_cs_vs_uc_berkeley_cs/

I've seen yet another Ed post today requesting for hw solutions during &amp; at the end of the semester. Prof. Ferguson or TAs has chosen to ignore, ridicule, or pay lip service to all past requests for hw/midterm solutions. Evidence: https://filebin.net/1c1x13u07syp6o9y

As someone who nearly couldn't solve hw3(I'm talking about the non-programming track, not even the programming track), I was expecting at least a partial solution. But no, no hw solution is allowed for us mortals. And then there is hw4 and more, which built on top of the techniques tested in hw3. You get the idea. 

How do we grow as a student? Imagine Jae didn't pose any solution for any of his AP labs - yes certainly some will argue there're ample TA/prof OH for one to clarify questions. But here we have AP still, with same if not better degree of OH support, have all of their lab solutions posted promptly. It is not an excuse to not deliver a student's request; worse, such requests are simply ignored or even ridiculed:

vd7e44,Questions/Advice about CS @ CU (Esp. Math Classes!),"Hey guys,

I‚Äôm a Sophomore transfer student in the college who‚Äôs set to matriculate in the Fall. I plan on switching my major and starting fresh in CS so I feel quite behind considering I haven‚Äôt taken an introductory CS course and I‚Äôll be a sophomore when school starts around. That being said, I‚Äôm trying to get ahead of some requirements over the summer and would greatly appreciate any of the advice you guys might have. 

Right now I‚Äôm deciding to pick either Discrete Mathematics and Calc III or take both of them over the summer. I already have AP Calc BC credit from HS which exempts me from the CS Calc requirement since I only need to get to Calc II but I haven‚Äôt touched any math in 1-2 years and was curious if taking Calc III would be beneficial in terms of acting as a prerequisite or just for my general well-being. I‚Äôm also curious if I should take Discrete Math ahead of time as well and was wondering what your guys‚Äô thoughts might be on taking that over the summer.

I‚Äôm super excited and grateful to be a part of Columbia this year, but I‚Äôm also intimidated by the fact that I‚Äôll be a Sophomore with virtually 0 experience in CS. I switched majors because I felt much more passionate about CS than my previous major and though I‚Äôm self-studying Java right now, I‚Äôd be super happy to hear any comments or advice when it comes to catching-up/CS@CU/internships/etc. Thanks so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/vd7e44/questionsadvice_about_cs_cu_esp_math_classes/,Sogumee,1,2022-06-15 19:09:00,0,/r/columbia/comments/vd7e44/questionsadvice_about_cs_cu_esp_math_classes/

vdrpju,looking for advice on math for CS major,"I'm a computer science major and have completed intro and Data Structures. I'm in GS and haven't been in school for about a decade. I breezed through intro and although I ultimately got a good grade, I struggled in Data Structures with the math. I haven't taken a math class since calc in high school and i found myself struggling to remember what logarithms are each time I did the DS work. I also had a really hard time with the proofs we had to do and there were often symbols and equations that left me at a loss.  
I'm registered for Discrete Math in the fall but I'm wondering if I should take something before that. AP calc from high school transferred to CU so I could qualify for calc 2 or 3 but I don't remember a thing so I would have to retake calc 1.  
Wondering if anyone has been in this situation and has any advice on the best way forward.  
Some questions I have:  
\- Does Discrete math rely heavily on calc 1 and 2 or 3?   
\- Will I be at a huge disadvantage in upper level major courses if I don't focus on getting a really solid calc foundation now?  
Some concerns:  
\- I attend part time and I really don't want to break the momentum of the CS classes to take only math classes for a full year. I am hoping to take AP in the spring.  
\- Cost. I will most likely end up doing some sort of calc 1 course online and not through Columbia if it's necessary.

ve682v,Research Opportunity,"Dear Members of the Columbia community or residents of New York City,

I am Robyn An, a rising sophomore at Barnard College. I took BIOL-BC1001(Introduction to Organismal and Evolutionary Biology) in Fall 2021. I was really inspired by Professor Glendinning's research in understanding how the sense of taste controls behavioral and metabolic responses to sweeteners, complex carbohydrates, and alcohol.

Recently, I began researching the effects of thyroid hormones and their effects on metabolism and weight loss. I am currently studying how dicalcium phosphate, L-tyrosine, zinc citrate, potassium iodide, DL-phenylalanine, and selenium can positively impact weight loss in decreased BMI and waist circumference. I believe my work has the potential to combat the globally rising obesity rate and its risks, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, hypothyroidism, and such. My goal is to develop a weight loss/diet pill with minimal side effects that could potentially flatten the increasing obesity rate in the United States and worldwide.

I was wondering if there is anyone out there who would like to participate in this research opportunity. I emailed Professor Glendinning to see if he could potentially mentor me along the research process. I heard back from him saying that ""to conduct a project on that topic, you would need to find someone at Columbia or elsewhere in New York City that is doing similar research."" Please message me if you are interested or have any questions. Thank you.

Warm Regards,

vec96y,Looking for a Tutor for Calc I for Summer B,"Hi!

I am quaking in my boots as I imagine taking Calc I in Summer B (classic ""not a maths person"") and also because I am traumatized by failing this class at Middlebury in my first go-around as an undergrad. As such, I'm looking to prep myself with an arsenal of resources to avoid a repeat performance. Naturally, I also have an insane amount of anxiety around the material, etc.

I obviously am willing to pay someone, and am seeking tutoring 2-3x per week for 1-2 hours - Zoom can likely work so the person wouldn't have to be in NYC - I don't have a preference. 

Feel free to DM me your rate and avail - would need someone who could be reliable and commit avail from 07/05 - 08/12, even if only by Zoom. Preference for a tutor that is super experienced in the subject and knows the material back and front.

vffc0l,Accelerated MVC/Linear Algebra vs. Honors Math A/B for Applied Math Major in CC?,"Hey everyone, 

Incoming freshman planning to study applied math in CC. Big emphasis on the applied‚Äîstuff like differential equations, dynamical systems, and fourier analysis etc turn me on a little and phrases like set theory, number theory, abstract algebra do the opposite. 

I'm unsure what math track to start with. From what I know, the honors sequence seems more rigorous and is advised for math majors, but also much more theoretical, abstract, and proof-based, which doesn't sound too appealing; meanwhile the MVC/lin alg track consists of more traditional content, though still at an accelerated pace. 

I have a pretty good background in math having taken calc, mvc, dfq, lin alg, and discrete in HS, so hopefully rigor won't be too much of an issue, though I do have basically no experience in abstract, proof-oriented material. 

Was wondering if anyone had advice on this‚Äîif I opt for MVC/lin alg, could I could get away with not taking any pure-math-style classes throughout all four years? Is that even a good idea, or should I go for the Honors path to try to develop some background in pure/theoretical content, despite my focus in applied math? 

Any thoughts from math majors or just anyone who's taken these classes would help a ton.

vfwfpf,They laughed when I said I wanted to make new friends. But when I started to work on it...,"College wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting.

All the brochures and content showed college to be such a fun and uplifting place.

But the truth is, it‚Äôs literally close to impossible to make friends after your 1st freshmen semester. I, just like so many others, go back to our rooms alone after class on most days.

Making friends in class is possible, but most disappear after the group work is done. Fair enough.

When it‚Äôs so easy to put earpieces over our ears and head back home after class alone, have all the entertainment and food you need, nobody has a real reason to approach others to start a conversation and make new friends out of class.

Nowadays, socializing seems to happen through Ig stories, texting, emojis‚Ä¶ and now tiktok. And that really feels empty as the days pass

We can‚Äôt really blame it. It‚Äôs convenient. We don‚Äôt have to deal with real life awkwardness. We‚Äôre in our comfort zone.

We act like we‚Äôre ok. However, nobody‚Äôs really talking about how empty we feel when we don‚Äôt exchange stories with others in real time. That‚Äôs bcos we‚Äôre afraid of looking needy, vulnerable.

And the lack of exchanging stories irl kinda suck a lot of life out of me.

The saving grace is every so occasionally I get to meet friends irl and talk.

It‚Äôs not that I have social anxiety, it‚Äôs just that there isn‚Äôt an appropriate opportunity to socialize. I joined clubs to make friends. But sometimes, other students laughed at me for showing my vulnerability. 

It didn't matter. I wanted to solve this socializing problem.

None of the current platforms we have, helped us in socializing, otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt even have this problem now. I believe we need not stay suffocated to the tech we have currently. Bcos our social media were created by students who lived in the era more than 10 years ago. Maybe it‚Äôs time for a change for the college students in the 2020s.

I started to change what i did when i was alone in my room. From endlessly scrolling IG, tiktok and sometimes Snapchat‚Ä¶ to lots of questioning.

My lonely pangs started to drop. I felt like I was on a mission. Bcos I wanted to solve it. For myself, if not for the thousands of college students suffering from the same fate as me‚Ä¶

And even if I didn‚Äôt solve it, maybe some other students who really hated this problem could come along after me to solve it once I made some headway into it.

Some questions I constantly asked myself:

\- Is texting, Ig stories the only way for us to stay in touch with our friends?  
\- What makes irl interactions so different from online ones?  
\- Why do I feel lonely? How can I remove it?  
\- How do I merge the benefits of irl interactions with the convenience of staying in the room?  
\- How can I help introverts experience less awkwardness and social anxiety when talking?  
\- How to make it more fun for college students to chat more?  
\- How can I find someone who‚Äôs like-minded in the same college/city?  
\- What can make making new friends easier across the 4 years and not only for the freshmen‚Äôs first semester?

Our mental health will definitely improve if we can talk more with each other. Not just with our current friends but with new friends whom we can relate to. It excited me that I could make a dent in mental health issues!! bcos i‚Äôve seen my friends suffer from it and it‚Äôs not nice :(

For months, I dedicated myself to building this. It started from a problem I hated: the lack of social interactions in college, but gradually, it was not just about myself anymore. it was about ‚ÄòCould I help my friends and other students get a happier college life?‚Äô

I came up with this: **Google for socializing in college - connect with new/current friends through voice stories, not text**

Basically, post a voice story, find those you relate to through their voice stories, dm them through voice, chat and get into a 1-1 voice call if yall vibe. Once yall are connected as friends, when your friends post a new voice story, you can hear them. Expands your social circle while keeping you in contact with current friends.

It‚Äôs called ‚ÄòOkepos‚Äô. This stands for ‚ÄòGarden‚Äô in Greek. I want us all to find the garden of friends we deserve. It‚Äôs a shitty beta version now and it‚Äôs free on the appstore. if this is up your alley, do check it out, lmk your feedback (no feedback is small) and I‚Äôll improve on it.

College might not be the best time of our lives, our futures can indeed be brighter, but at least we deserve a chance to make the best out of our college lives. Right now.

***To the mods of Columbia, if this doesn‚Äôt fit your requirements, please delete it. But I feel like you should play a part in helping removing loneliness in our college. You would have experienced that kind of feeling before and you know it sucks. So many students are suffering. If this student project can make a dent in the mental health issues in our college and help more of us chat more by voice, you should support this.***",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/vfwfpf/they_laughed_when_i_said_i_wanted_to_make_new/,okepos,1,2022-06-19 10:30:59,0,/r/columbia/comments/vfwfpf/they_laughed_when_i_said_i_wanted_to_make_new/

vhsw3w,"What's with this $2,000 start-up/small business grant Columbia is planning to give to incoming low-income freshman this year?","I'm going to be a second-year FGLI student this fall and I just saw this news on the Columbia instagram. It seems like such a cool opportunity, but I am a bit confused about it. I looked on the Columbia website, but they did not explain any further details on it. What about all the other FGLI Columbia students from other years who have really been wanting to create startups and businesses but didn't have the grant money? Will they not be able to request this grant money for their startup since they're not considered first years? Does anyone know if there is an application process in order to claim this money, or are they just automatically throwing out the money to first-year FGLI students without questioning it??? I've really been wanting to create a small business myself for a long time, and I would be kinda sad if they only gave this opportunity to only co2026 fgli students, and excluding the other FGLI classes :(.

Also say that they were to give out the grant money to fgli students, and the fgli students were to do very well in their businesses \*hypothetically\*, would that mean that those fgli students wouldn't be considered fgli students anymore and eventually have to pay more of their college tuition and get reduced financial aid??? Bc if that's the case, then that'd be a scheme on Columbia's part to create an easier way to get these prior fgli students to produce more money to pay back to the school technically if you really think about it. It's kinda like Columbia were to say: ""Hey FGLI students! We give you money to create potentially successful businesses that will produce money, and in return, you can hopefully pay us back more money in the future bc you'll no longer be in financial need!!!11!!"" Idk if I'm thinking about this in a simplistic or wrong way lmk. If that's the scheme they are going for, Imma be pissed! Lmao and if that's the case, I'd rather not get the grant to create a successful business, so that I can secure my tuition-free education. Maybe I'll create my business once I've graduated and wouldn't have to worry about paying the potential income on college tuition.

vhymqa,Just sad,"I am a rising sophomore. My Fall semester grades were not great (low 3s,less that 3.5).I feel like spring semester was so much better in terms of learning. Like I found better study habits, used the resources at my disposal (OH, study groups..etc). I feel like I have learned so much more this past semester, was happier, I even had my first A. My lithum spring papers were so much better than last semester‚Äôs. The maths class I took this semester went so much better than lasts (I got an A-).However,my spring gpa (not cumulative)is only 0.1 higher than my fall gpa, which just makes me sad. It feels like I am still at the same point.It just really feels anticlimactic. I do not know how to feel about this tbh.
Do not get me wrong,I know why my grades were what they were for spring eg LitHum- should have spoken more often in class, too focused on nailing the papers and also I am pretty shy. Econ-did great on the midterm, I did not do well on a 25-point question during the final. (..etc)
Also, I feel like even if I do great on next semester ( which I think I can,since I learned my way through college this past 2 semesters) my cumulative gpa will not reflect that‚Ä¶. which is sad really (Side note:Maybe it is because I am international, but I think I hate cumulative gpa‚Ä¶.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/vhymqa/just_sad/,Such-Theme,1,2022-06-22 02:40:18,0,/r/columbia/comments/vhymqa/just_sad/

vkj9p7,Help/Advise needed: I'll be on a 17h flight on the day of Course Registration,"Hey everyone,

I'm in a little bit of a predicament, and i wanted some advice from this community. I'm an incoming graduate student at the EE Department at SEAS.

I found out recently that course registration is on August 8th. As it so happens, I'm going to be flying to the US on August 8th. I've converted all dates and times to EST (NY time for ease)

Essentially, my flight takes off at 3:30pm on August 8th and i land in the US at 9:30am on August 9th. As you can see, I'll pretty much be on the flight for the entirety of August 8th, however i do have the window of the few hours before i take off from my home country to possibly quickly register and get on the flight. 

When i found out i panicked. Because i don't want to miss out on the courses that i wish to take at Columbia because i was on flight and didn't register quick enough. I wish to take 2 CS and 1 EE course in my first semester. I've heard that CS (naturally) courses are in high demand and usually get filled up fast. 

I wrote to the course administrator at the EE Department (Elsa Sanchez). I wanted to know what time course registration usually opened, so that i could make an informed decision and evaluate taking the risk of maybe registering for the courses prior to take off. This was her response:

""The registration period is usually from 9:30am - 9:30pm, 12:30pm-9:30pm or 5:10-9:30pm.""

This is a little alarming as the registration process is now tentative. 

Some of my friends/seniors at Columbia/roomates offered to register for courses for me on my behalf, when i told them my predicament. But as someone who doesn't like to take chances, I'm a weary. What if I'm on the flight as some eventualities arise - they run into issues and aren't able to reach me? I wouldn't want to leave such an important aspect such as course registration on someone else, but me. 

I also understand that on flights nowadays there is wifi, but naturally I'd prefer finishing any registration/work related prior to taking off - no stress.

I'm a little torn and I'm very unsure as to how to proceed. Should I reschedule my flight to a day later/prior? Should I just take the risk and fly on August 8th? 

I don't want to be put on a waitlist for a course and miss out on the first few weeks till people drop out of it.

I know that the course registration process is fairly simple and is a few clicks, so it's not going to be something too tedious/time consuming. 

What should I do?

Any advice/help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/vkj9p7/helpadvise_needed_ill_be_on_a_17h_flight_on_the/,QueefingPigeon,1,2022-06-25 12:55:47,0,/r/columbia/comments/vkj9p7/helpadvise_needed_ill_be_on_a_17h_flight_on_the/

vl54pj,Thoughts on Columbia's Sustainability Management Ms (Joint program between SPS and Columbia Climate School),"I'd love to talk to students / alumni of this program to understand more about what this program is!

I'm really interested in this program but have seen a ton of ""red flags"" regarding this program and others such as:

1. Some Columbia masters' programs are good, and some seem to be closer to ""cash cow"" programs with questionable academic quality. For this program, all of its classes are between 6 - 8pm (primarily because many of the students are supposed to be working full-time, although this has not been my observation)
2. Poor recruiting pipeline for international students
3. SPS program grads have salaries of 75k+ upon graduation, with 33% still seeking employment? I can't find any information on ""Sustainability Management"" grads as a whole, but these numbers are abysmal. I am actually shocked by this, as (in my experience) any degree from an Ivy League has non-zero value on the job market, even from a ""cash cow"" program.
4. Columbia students shitting on SPS generally. While I understand that SPS / masters are not as selective as undergrad + MBA programs, I would like to understand what makes SPS such a questionable school in the greater Columbia ecosystem.

I'm currently living in Europe and am really drawn to the idea of living in NYC, graduating from an Ivy League, and ""making it"". I'd love to hear your thoughts on some of the more specific aspects of this program and what I'm not seeing about Columbia SPS from the outside-in.

vm3w17,First Year Scheduling Advice,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm wondering if there are any thoughts on a fall semester schedule. I understand this is 18 credits, however I want to know the feasibility of these classes. I‚Äôm sort of thinking about the Math/Comp Sci major??? But I am also trying to do things that would be beneficial regardless of what major I end up in (Core classes, language, intro to comp sci, math). 

1. Lit Hum (4 credits)
2. Uni Writing (3) or Frontiers of Science (4)
3. Elementary German I (4)
4. Intro to Comp/Java (3)
5. Calc II (3)

My other option would be to do Chemistry (probably intensive Gen Chem or Organic and lab) instead of intro to comp/java and German, and I would hit the 18 credit limit as well. My understanding, though, is that people tend to enjoy intro to comp/java more as compared to Chemistry and (perhaps is less taxing?), although the same amount of credits. I‚Äôve heard pre-med at Columbia is hell and I am trying to just gauge my options. 

Would appreciate (constructive) feedback please. I don‚Äôt want to go in delusional and put myself through hell but I‚Äôm quite reasonably interested in all of these classes.

I‚Äôm in a bit of a rut atm and wanted to ask for advice. I‚Äôm a MechE major and my freshman year wasn‚Äôt the best in terms of grades. I have a &gt;3 gpa and wanted to plan my next semester to maximise grades. 

I have three options:

Either take requirements for my major to stay on track with 1 nontech OR take 2 required classes with 3 nontechs OR 3 required classes and 2 nontechs


The last scenario is what my advisor recommended. However I‚Äôm leaning more towards the second one. I‚Äôm confident that getting an A in a nontech will be easier for me than in a required class. 

I guess my question is will having more nontechs on my schedule positively impact my grade to get it up to at least a 3.5 or should I just accept it and try my best with the required classes?

vmdpvm,What's the best job you've worked at while being at Columbia and how much did they pay?,"Fuck the title, Imma be 100 with y'all, as a low-income student, I feel kinda sad and a bit of FOMO when I see the rich nepo kids choosing the easiest majors, not having to study extremely hard on a Friday night at Butler, having fun at fancy restaurants every weekend, and working out at Equinox. That plus the mixture of school stress puts me in a sad mood sometimes, and I was thinking about getting a little part-time job aside from my work study so that I can save up a bunch of money mainly so I can afford going out to cool places and having fun in the city once in a while, but I don't want to work too far from campus bc then my whole paycheck would just go for paying subway transportation. I want to make as much money as possible without having to kill myself working. Where do y'all find these kind of jobs? How much do you get paid? Or should I just prioritize all my time in studies and school clubs and just keep hope that my future tech job money will come in 3 years when I graduate? Now that I didnt get a tech internship this summer and barely know any coding language inside and out, Im scared that I'll be one of those Columbia student failure stories, where the person graduates with an ivy degree but then graduates with no job or internship experience at all. I'm a material girl at heart that desires to experience the finer things in life and go shopping and travel the world with my girlfriends, but I just get so impatient for that moment I could afford nice things, bc I got people my age already living the luxury lifestyle I've always wanted. Just a random idea: but instead I was also thinking about saving up money to go on a trip to Europe with friends next summer. I haven't told them about it, but I've been thinking about it since I'm low income and never really got the chance to travel before. What's y'alls opinions? I'm in a financial fix. I want to treat myself with something expensive that I've never had before, but Idk if I should just save the money I worked for instead. Like I want to treat myself at least once bc I feel like I deserve it after burning myself out with studies, but at the same time it'd pain me to spend the money I worked for through many months in just one week for a nice trip. And at the same time I dont want my financial aid to get cut a bit just because I earned a lot of income through jobs in one year, in the hypothetical case I were to make a lot of money from a small business. So maybe I get an under the table job? I know seeing people my age live nice lifestyles should be motivating for me, and it actually used to be like that before, but ever since a few months ago my mind shifted, and I get sad and impatient knowing that right now at the moment I am extremely far from the type of lifestyle I want. I've been working hard, but it looks like not hard enough and as a result I'm very burnt out to learn new skills. sorry the ramble, idk idk help :( :/",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/vmdpvm/whats_the_best_job_youve_worked_at_while_being_at/,Hot_Tumbleweed6052,1,2022-06-27 23:50:44,0,/r/columbia/comments/vmdpvm/whats_the_best_job_youve_worked_at_while_being_at/

vmybxb,Columbia SEAS course flow chart (Computer Science),"I'm an incoming freshman at SEAS and am going to major in Computer Science. Im also considering graduating in 3 yrs to do an ms (tho may well take 3.5 yrs, 4 yrs, or even do the ms express). 

I made these charts, with the help of a few Columbia students, to just get a general idea of what I would need to complete in order to graduate. Any advice in regard to courses, tracks, or anything else related would be much appreciated!

[Chart without specific GTE\/Track Courses](https://preview.redd.it/77s9bstegf891.png?width=2013&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1dd6466a4ad268d531bf71b41fb1220c6e420c0)

\* Its way too early to pick specific GTE or track courses, tho i just filled out the chart with a few I found to be interesting (I'm sure they'll end up changing, however).

\* Im aware that graduating in 3yrs has several drawbacks, and Im not set on it yet. However, doing so would allow me to graduate with both a bs and ms and with minimal debt

\* Aware that I only need 2 PE credits (and that I may have trouble getting them first year)

\* May take a summer class or two, as I heard the scholars program gives housing over the summer of research - tho with this schedule I would not need to take summer classes to graduate

\* Last one lol - also aware that the schedule is pretty rigorous however, I was never gonna take the min credits to graduate anyway, and its only realistically 2 credits over the avg (of 16/per semester) if you ignore PE

vn39uw,Is there a general order that people take cs classes at Columbia SEAS?,"CS Core:

Prerequeisite: Python (ENGI W1006)

1. Intro to CS and Programming in Java (COMS W1004, 3ps) or Honors Intro to CS (COMS W1007, 3ps) 

2. Data Structures in Java (COMS W3134, 3ps) or Honors Data Structures and Algorithms (COMS W3137, 4pts) 

3. Advanced Programming (COMS W3157, 4pts) 

4. Discrete Mathematics (COMS W3203, 3pts until Fall 2019, 4pts from Spring 2020) 

5. Computational Linear Algebra (COMS 3251, 4pts, Recommended) or Linear Algebra (MATH 2010, APMA 3101, or APMA 2101, 3pts) 

6. Computer Science Theory (COMS 3261, 3pts) 

7. Fundamentals of Computer Systems (CSEE 3827, 3pts)

&amp;#x200B;

Im assuming the order at least somewhat follows the guide above, tho are certain courses better to take early vs late on, or is it good to pair certain ones?

I heard some people recommend taking Advanced Programming and Fundamentals of Computer Systems concurrently? Tho also that AP is better to take before fundies as id be better prepared for the assembly language programming that comes in the second half of Fundies?

Lastly I'm assuming that track coursework only starts after or near the end of where the core cs courses end? And also that GTE's can be interspersed between CS courses as they are just STEM in general?

Any advice would be much appreciated!

vp2tu0,Barnard/Columbia Culture,"Hello Peeps :)

I've been starting my college search this summer, and I really fell in love with Barnard. From what I've seen, it has exactly the type of community I'm looking for. But, I've been talking with a few students who have visited and toured Barnard and I've been told that many of the students are in it for the Ivy League clout and not because they actually appreciate Barnard for what it is. 

Barnard students: do you feel like that's true? I really love Barnard, but I don't want to be surrounded by people who chose the college just because they wanted to gain the prestige of Columbia. In the info sessions, it seems like people apply because they actually like the school, but I would also appreciate an inside perspective. I'm for sure applying, and considering maybe ED'ing to Barnard.

I'm not sure if this is breaking any rules. If it is, I apologize for the inconvenience :(

Throughout my time at the lab I can't say that the work I was a part of was particulalry engaging from a theoretical standpoint but it did teach me some fundental lab techniques. Now I'm interning at a pharmaceutical company this summer and the labwork is by far more interesting and meaningful not only conceptually but from a practical standpoint as well. Knowing now what I find to be labwork that is actually fun to be a part of I think I want to work at another lab on campus that more closely mirrors the work I'm currently engaged in.

vv4lyq,"A really popular Indian podcaster is potentially lying about having gone to the School of General Studies, Columbia University.","Hi all,

I recently came across this podcast channel on youtube PG Radio ([https://www.youtube.com/c/PGRadio/about](https://www.youtube.com/c/PGRadio/about)).  The description says ""Prakhar Gupta, the host of this podcast, is a student of Economics and Psychology at Columbia University in the City of New York"".

Here is the facebook page ([https://www.facebook.com/PGradioo/](https://www.facebook.com/PGradioo/)). The About says "" A video podcast covering the stories of students from the Columbia University School of General Studies to discover their awe-inspiring life stories.""

However, the podcast episode list found here ([https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/9pg89-8ecb6/PG-Radio-Podcast](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/9pg89-8ecb6/PG-Radio-Podcast)) does not seem to contain anything relevant to Columbia University students based on a first glance at the episodes list.

Interestingly enough, I could not find a LinkedIN profile by the podcaster's name (Prakhar Gupta) that could connect the Columbia academic credentials to the podcast. Additionally, the only columbia related link that I could find was a profile on [columbia.academia.edu](https://columbia.academia.edu) (This one [https://columbia.academia.edu/PrakharGupta](https://columbia.academia.edu/PrakharGupta)). I do not personally understand the legitimacy of profiles created on that site.

Essentially, this could either all be a huge misunderstanding on my part or this individual (Prakhar Gupta) is misrepresenting his academic credentials as having graduated from the School of General Studies, Columbia University. This podcaster is pretty popular in India and discusses about a lot of contemporary issues in India and the Columbia University alumnus tag lends his voice a lot of credibility. If he is lying about this, a lot of people are falling for it and this is why I am making this post.

vwpbzz,NOT PAUL: A New Romantic Comedy That Features Columbia University,"Hey everyone,

I am the writer and star of ""Not Paul"" - an original one-act romantic comedy about constantly being compared to your partner's ex that is DEBUTING JULY 15TH at the Producers Club in Hell's Kitchen (358 W 44th St). The play explores the topics of perfectionism, academia, post-college life, feelings of inadequacy, and reclaiming your self-worth. Two of the characters in the show are academic publishers at Columbia University Press. We would like to make the show more accessible for college students so we are offering a 10 percent discount if you use the promo code: STUDENT

ABOUT THE PLAY:

The play centers around a new couple: Mary and Ethan. Mary is Ivy League-educated and a successful academic publisher, while Ethan is a barista with a theology degree, uncertain of what he wants to do with his life. Their budding romance is complicated when Ethan learns of Mary‚Äôs recent ex, Paul, her committed boyfriend of five years. Paul is a perfect man: he was top of his class at Harvard, a gifted singer, a talented actor, delivered speeches to the United Nations about the South Sudan famine, speaks seven languages fluently, and is a sexual god. Even during the action of the play, Paul is saving Ukrainian refugees.

As their relationship progresses, Ethan discovers that all the people in Mary‚Äôs life love Paul to the point of obsession. Mary‚Äôs elderly next door neighbor Greta was infatuated with Paul. Mary‚Äôs college friends and recently married couple, Bryce and Stewart, follow the word of Paul. Mary‚Äôs co-worker Sylvia reveals that she is pregnant with Paul‚Äôs child and her husband, Perry, couldn‚Äôt be more excited. All of them shamelessly compare Ethan to Paul and display open hostility towards him, causing Ethan to snap, as he begins to question himself and his relationship. Either Ethan takes charge of his own life or Paul‚Äôs admirers will take matters into their own hands‚Ä¶

WE HAVE SIX PERFORMANCES:

FRIDAY, JULY 15TH - 8PM

SATURDAY, JULY 16TH - 8 PM

SATURDAY, JULY 23RD - 8PM

Basically I'm strongly considering EDing for Columbia- I like Columbia's core curriculum (at least right now), small class sizes, LAC feel, NYC location, all that. It's also close to my friends. 

I'm just wondering how ""supportive"" the Columbia community is? Is it a cutthroat atmosphere? A supportive, collaborative one? I'd prefer the latter. 

Are people generally nice, including professors? Are they approachable? Asking also because I know New York is known for rude people and that kind of scares me as a West Coaster lol 

I heard also there's a lot of ""hidden fees"" for Columbia... such as orientation fees, health whatnot etc. Is this true?

vz12zj,Do I turn down a free ride for Columbia?,"I was accepted for the fall as GS transfer. Columbia's offered some money, but I have a free ride to Rutgers.

I am NOT excited about Rutgers. It's an excellent school, but:

1) it's way too big and I'm not a fan of the **All American State College** vibe.

2) I'm almost 30, so I'd be surrounded by people ten years younger. Sure, that's the case at any school, but moving to a college town means you have no escape from that, you're stuck in a bubble. 

Columbia's and NYC (where I've lived before) are far more preferable choices across the board-- except for the teensy detail of the price tag. 

I know it seems like a no-brain to dodge the bullet (read: cannonball) of student debt, but I'm THAT unenthusiastic to go to Rutgers. Justifying the mountain of debt I'd get into at Columbia is hard, and it's even harder knowing you can study elsewhere for free. 

I'm curious to read what the Columbia community has to say about it, especially GS students and alumni. What would you do in this situation?

w0424q,How do credits and courses numbers work Columbia (prefrosh)?,"In regard to credits, Ive heard its more down to the number of classes that you take. For example, 5 classes will be a good bit easier than 6 even if the total number of credits is the same:

A: 3+3+3+3+3+3 = 18 credits (6 courses)

B: 4+4+4+3+3 = 18 credits (5 courses) - easier option?

Also for example, Ive heard art of engineering (4 credits), is a lot easier than many 3 credit classes? So does a class being 3 or 4 credits not change much in what I should expect?

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, how do course numbers work? The guide says that 4000 lvl courses are grad school classes available to undergrads, while 6000 are grad school classes. However the first cs track had 6000 lvl classes that you can choose from? Which doesn't really make much sense, bc they are therefore available to undergrads?

On the same note, how does difficulty change between 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 6000 lvl courses? Is there a significant jump from 1 to the next, or are the jumps at certain spots say 1000, 2000, 3000, are more or less the same whilst there's a big jump up to 4000?

I just recently transferred from another university to Columbia. I've registered for my classes in the fall and am beginning to be nervous about whether I'll be overcome by my course load.

Furthermore, I was wondering how Intro to Modern Algebra as a course was, the 4000-level one, particularly with Professor Sawin. Does GU mean this is also open to graduates? Does that make getting a good grade in the class harder?

w3473o,Yale or Columbia - B.S Computer Science,"Recently got off the waitlist at Yale, am currently committed to Columbia SEAS.

Which is the better option?

Yale seems to have the slightly weaker cs department, but I think thats mostly because they are more undergrad focused. Also Yale seems to have the better overall undergrad experience, along with slightly more prestige?

Columbia is arguably stronger for cs, and being in New York could be an advantage - not sure? Tho, less prestige, and they have some weird things like General Studies (33% acceptance rate), Barnard (also given Columbia's name but again easier to get into), high transfer rates, and a ton of 3+2 yr programs with other schools, not to even begin to mention their cash cow cs masters degree.

I feel like these all deduct from the general name brand of the school, and although not everything is about prestige, that is a big reason people apply to these schools in the first place?

Also Yale seems to have the stronger alumni network (higher endowment, and donation ratio), however Columbia likely has more STEM alumni.

I am considering graduate school, so GPA does matter quite a bit (avg Stanford ms admit in stats has a 3.9). Ive heard Columbia SEAS is alot more rigorous than Yale and would make getting a high GPA near impossible?

Kinda lost...

w4qtey,Question About Math and Applied Physics Double Major,"Hey everyone. I'm an incoming freshman to Columbia Class of 2026, and am really interested in Math and Physics. I was wondering: if I want to pursue theoretical topics in math (i.e. analysis, algebra, topology, differential geometry, and later work in analytic number theory and stochastic systems) and more applied topics in physics (plasma, fusion, and quantum computing) while still retaining the core theory of the field, what combination of majors might work best for me?

I had initially planned Theoretical Math and Physics as a double major in CC, but am now realizing that perhaps the SEAS APAM double major might suit me better. How much emphasis on pure math is placed in AM, and (if anyone has any experience with these majors) what would be recommended for my particular interests?

w57tgx,An Argument Grades Shouldn't Exist,"Hello Columbians, (do we say that?)

I'm a premed, and the most common remark I hear from my fellow premed Columbia students is how stressed and depressed they are about schoolwork, how they can't keep up, and how they feel that their entire lives hinge on grades that they have to destroy their mental health to get. While these may be examples of all or nothing statements, there is significant truth to this when it comes to students who plan on attending graduate level programs like medical school. Personally, I want my Doctor's to have had happy and healthy undergraduate experiences, (like I'm not,) I want them to have had time to play tennis on the weekends (like I don't,) and I want them to have time to go to their own Dr apts so that they're healthy enough to actualize themselves *and* to take care of others. 

Grades are often used as a way to determine whether someone is a good candidate for grad programs, and that makes sense in a way. You have to jump through a lot of hoops to get good grades. You have to put in sustained effort over a long period of time. These are attractive qualities to an employer or grad school. What these grades don't tell you is how passionate someone is about the topic they want to pursue in their life. These grades don't tell you why students are pursuing a career in xyz profession. Grades are an arbitrary deterrent that helps grad schools (and some employers) weed out people from their application process. I don't care if the engineer who built the bridge I drive on is neurodivergent and found Uwriting hard, (although I loved that class,) I want them to be able to flourish and build great bridges. As a neurodiverse individual myself, some stuff comes extremely easy, and some stuff does not. 

The point is that entrance exams and application weedouts don't need to be abolished entirely, but I believe there should be an alternative system that is more applicable to the field that you intend on entering. God forbid you have to take the retched GRE. Those questions are simply questions for point's sake. 

Do you agree or disagree? Do you have a better idea? Tell me why.

w5pkc9,Any little admissions tips for rising juniors/seniors in high school who plan on applying early decision for Columbia?,"I'm a rising junior in high school ('24) who's thoroughly interested in applying early decision to Columbia when the time comes.

 I've researched the school pretty extensively, especially the core, which I absolutely love. I want to major in something STEM, like neuroscience or biophysics, as I plan to go pre-med. And the reason I love the core curriculum so much is because as passionate I am about science and math, I've always been super passionate about humanities &amp; literature too. I love reading Plato and Homer as much as I love solving differential equations haha. But that's basically why I'm so interested in the core; it feels like it was almost made for me in a sense--  at Columbia, I can get a vast liberal education while still pursing my passions in science/math. I've tried my best to tell that story (the duality of my stem/humanities passion) through my transcript, such as both AP Art History &amp; AP Chem which I just took my sophomore year. I'm thinking I'll definitely be diving deep into that on my Columbia supplementals lol.

Anyways, I know you all don't care about that haha; just wanted to give some background into why I want to go to Columbia.

Hopefully I find a program or internship that is beginner/entry-level/Java+Python basics-friendly for next summer.

Any good YT channels for leetcode that helped you out in the process? What were the common concepts or questions asked in your coding interviews? What do you think made you standout for the internship?

Pls tell me about your experience in your past SWE internships and what you learned from them, or what realizations you had from them.

wcn8rx,How to search for jobs with my non stem degree?,"How can I search for jobs with my non stem degree?

Right now I'm just on indeed, usajobs, and LinkedIn searching for any office or support position that doesn't specify hard requirements like:

PhD
Jd
Licensed social work, teaching, nursing, e.t.c
CISSP
AWS, Oracle, DevOps
CPA
Master
X years as a (insert position here)

I'm looking for words like:
Assistant
Manager
Support 
Entry
Junior
Analyst
Internship or apprenticeship (most however disqualify me because I'm not actively or recently enrolled)

And I end up with jobs that are willing to pay 15 an hour (if not a scam).

I'd like to somehow get a job with an actual company or firm, however I almost never see postings for these. I know people will say ""network"", but 95%ignore me and if they don't, I'm ultimately redirected to their company's job board and end up with the same exact problem. 

This is really the biggest problem I've encountered when applying as a Columbia grad (really just a grad in general). I've also run into so many scams, sales pitches, jobs that ghost you or don't respond (even federal ones). 

I'm hoping this post helps all the guys who reached out to me yesterday saying they experience the same exact thing.

I have taken: Calc I/II + Multivariable + differential equations, complex analysis, logic/proofs, and graduate linear algebra. I understand that people tout accelerated physics as a course with underplayed mathematical prerequisites.

I also got 5s in AP physics 1, 2, C mech, C E/M, and took an cosmology course through university after I finished these courses. I got up to a 14/25 on the F=ma physics competition but no USAPhO by a couple marks because I never prepared for it specifically.

I also worked through all the problem sets and appropriate readings on

http://www.columbia.edu/~nhc1/UN2802/assignments/assignments.html

this summer. I have programming experience in Python and C++ (USACO Gold + conference research for computational physics).

Is it wise to take Accelerated? I‚Äôm very interested in physics and am allowed to take Introduction to Modern algebra this year. I‚Äôve worked through about 4-5 problem sets of Modern and it‚Äôs going okay so far - I hear the course is alright and is honestly less work than honors mathematics, which I placed out of privately (I am taking 4-meeting seminar UN2005 concurrently to reinforce my proofwriting ability).

wimel5,Thoughts on Course Load and Difficulty for Deep Learning with Zemel? Or other F22 Course suggestions for a student working full-time,"Hi all,  

I‚Äôm currently planning to take COMS 4995 Neural Networks and Deep Learning with Zemel for the upcoming Fall 2022 semester. From what I have read, Zemel is a good professor - but how difficult and tedious is the coursework? How math heavy is it - and is it more theory or calc? Any other tips or advice?

Or should I consider a different course like Applied ML with Pappu or Cloud Computing with Ferguson? I want to get a deeper understanding of deep learning so I would like to take this course at some point (is there a better professor), but I don‚Äôt want to overwhelm myself given my work obligations.

For reference, I have a background in Python, CS, and AI and work full-time in the tech field for 40-50 hours depending in the week, but also not trying to go overboard with doing both - also from a more applied background and it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve done some calc calculations. I just know with conference season coming up, I will be traveling here and there as well during the semester. Any feedback is appreciated!

I am an incoming premed major at CC, and I am having trouble deciding what classes to take. I am thinking about doing something like neuro but doing cs is honestly a possibility so I will be testing the water with that by doing an intro to cs course pass/fail.

Here are my dilemmas for the time being.

1) Calc 1 vs Calc 3. Assuming that I don't go into any math, is there any merit to taking calc 3 from calc 1?

2) Which chem do I take? I really want to only take one course of Chem and I have done fine on AP Chem but I really don't want to take 2 semesters of Chem. Intensive Chem definitely seems like an option but the teacher doesn't look too kind on culpa/culpameter (Wei Min). For anyone that has taken the class or have had Wei Min as a teacher specifically, should I go for it or just take regular gen chem?

wkpj8j,Double Major in Computer Science and Mathematics,"Hi, I am an incoming freshman at CC and want to double major in Computer Science and Math separately. 

Since I am interested in quantitative finance, I was wondering what courses I should take to effectively fulfill (I realize there is a lot of course overlap) the CS and Math requirements that will really develop my skills to break into this field. \*I am considering getting a master's degree or a PhD.

For my fall course load, I will be taking Intro to CS and Calc 3 (in addition to Lit Hum and UW/FroSci). My high school did not offer much AP, so I only have a 5 in Calc AB and plan to transfer the credits by taking Calc 3. If I get a grade above a C in Calc 3 and get my AP credits, do I still need to take Calc 1 or 2 to fulfill the math major requirement? Is it possible to double major in CS and Math with virtually no AP credits? I will have the language requirement waived and the requirements for my major(s) would cover the additional courses for FroSci.

wnm3nn,A question on law and academia," A company a friend works for sent some email notes to some professors at Harvard Business School.

The professors in question are: Mihir Desai, Srikant Datar (the current Dean), Nitin Nohria (the previous Dean) and an HR staff person.

What is surprising is that the professors neither reply to the emails nor do they block them?

\-+-

Dear Prof. Desai,

Is it true that you treat white women differently at Harvard Business School?

I am talking about you personally.

Have you ever treated white women like dirt?

I bet you have not.

You wouldn't because that would mean a lawsuit.

But where you can, you can and do treat people under your control like dirt.

It is no wonder that American democracy is in peril.

Those who would ordinarily stand up for America no longer care to do so.

They don't even want to live in that country any more.

Nobody wants to deal with your ridiculous rules and ridiculous laws which just cause more shootings, more blacks in prison, more legal costs for everything and less of what people really need.

A lot of qualified people are no longer coming to America.

They are going to Australia, Canada and so on.

Atlas has truly shrugged!

We literally emailed said reddit posts to the professor himself. That guy neither blocks the email nor replies to them. Why?

wr01i5,Green Chemistry Merit Scholarship for Rising Columbia Seniors - Soft Deadline Saturday - Co-ops offered!," tl;dr This a personal appeal to apply to a private merit scholarship for which students in the NYC Area (including Long Island and Westchester) and Greater Houston are eligible. See [this link](https://www.nexanteca.com/ron-cascone-memorial-scholarship%C2%A0). Top winners will get an internship or co-op offer. **Fall co-op deadline is Aug 20.** We selected two winners this summer, both of whom are currently finishing up their summer internship working on a techno-economic report on green ammonia production.

\-----------------------

I've been in chemical engineering for over ten years. On my very first day, a man named Ron Cascone became my colleague, mentor, and friend. Not only did he teach me how to take my one semester of biochemistry and a few desultory months of fermentation research and somehow parlay it into a career at the forefront of the bio-renewable chemicals and fuels space, he spent his days connecting professionals, leading discussions, and sharing his wisdom with any and all who asked.

Ron was absurdly generous and passionate about his work and his industry. I once saw him help get two people hired as CTOs in two different industrial biotech startups in the course of a single day at a conference. Two years into my career I was with him when he personally guided investors to a then-unknown renewable chemicals company that recently went public. And more than anything, he embodied the mentorship culture at the company, NexantECA, where I've spent my career. In his opinion, everyone had the capability to learn new things and reinvent themselves as many times as they needed to, and he'd be along to help.

Ron passed away from cancer in early 2021. In his honor, I helped to convince the company to start offering a scholarship for people interested in continuing his legacy. And that's where you come in. We're awarding 4 students per year up to $5000 towards their tuition, and offering summer internships (already taken) and fall term co-ops besides. The scholarship/internship/co-op is nominally open to rising seniors in chemical engineering/chemistry, but we will accept outstanding exceptions.

We pay forward Ron's legacy. We want to give the gift of mentorship however we can: help with your senior design project, practice interviews and career advice, and more. Eligibility requirements and the application page is [here](https://www.nexanteca.com/ron-cascone-memorial-scholarship%C2%A0). We look at applications on a rolling basis in two rounds. Fall co-op applications are due August 20 - 3 days. The scholarship is 100% merit based.

We've been having trouble getting applicants because it turns out that school departments make it surprisingly difficult to give people money. I'm making a personal appeal - please apply! We want to give you the same gift that my mentor gave me for years and years, but also less educational debt. We've been running this scholarship for 2 years and all of our winners have been Redditors.

**FAQs**

*Really? Internships and co-ops?*

Yes, the reason we're focused on the Houston and NY areas is that those are two of our base locations. Our default for internship pay is hourly at twice local minimum wage, and you'd be involved in all of our daily work in the industry with at least one major project you will attach your name to. Co-ops are expected to work at least 8 hours per week while interns are full time.

*What are we looking for on the essay beyond the topic?*

Right now we don't have any fixed criteria. I can tell you that I, personally, think the best way to impress us is to use knowledge of the industry's current state and how it relates to your ambitions, and to keep it narrow (e.g., a single product or industry segment) rather than broad. I know this is hard to do considering that the way undergrad engineering works is that you spend years learning theory when professional engineers mainly work with established, existing procedures or equipment, but no one is expecting you to write like someone with my level of experience.

*How flexible are the admission criteria?*

As I said we will consider exceptional applicants outside of the strict requirements (i.e., non-chemistry/chemE majors, rising juniors, etc.). I'm on the committee that will be making the selection and I'll bat for you if you're a strong applicant. Unfortunately, I don't think we can bend on the US citizen criteria.

*Crap, I just saw this! Can I have an extension to apply?*

If you need an extension, I can only promise that we'll evaluate all applicants when the committee gets together regardless of whether or not they're in by the 20th. I'd push it to next Wednesday the 24th, but no later.

*How do we plan on disbursing funds?*

We'll pay it directly towards your tuition to the bursar. Be aware that merit scholarships can count against your financial aid allocation.

*Is this real?*

wr84cz,Housing in/commute from East Harlem?,"I am a recent Ph.D. graduate, and I am moving to Columbia for a postdoc starting this September. I've been having a rough time finding housing that's affordable (&lt;$1300). After a lot of searching, I found a nice apartment that checks all the boxes for me in East Harlem (Lexington Ave and 110s) that's relatively affordable.

The only hesitation I have is that it's in East Harlem, and I've read that it can be an unsafe part of the city, especially at night. I've visited NYC before but haven't ever lived there, and so it's hard for me to get a good sense for what's safe and what's not.

Here are my questions for people on this subreddit that have lived in that part of the city:
1. Are there specific neighborhoods in East Harlem that you'd recommend I avoid? 
2. Should I consider searching further and finding an apartment elsewhere?
3. Any idea about safety etc. around Lexington Ave/110-115 St specifically? 
4. Is commute to/from Columbia relatively safe from this part of the city at night?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now finished with my summer course and received the grade, but it was only very recently that I learned that the information on the website was actually outdated and STAT GU4001 was no longer one of the courses that satisfied my major requirements.

However, as an institution seemingly dedicated to climate research and sustainability, it seems odd the school would allocate so many resources - turf, labor, water, vehicles - to maintain chained-off, only occasionally accessible lawns around the Morningside Campus, for little more than marketing and the occasional frisbee sesh.

Don't get me wrong, they're beautiful (when not covered by white tarp, as they are most of the academic year) and allude to the aristocracy Columbia has historically perpetuated, but is it time to seek a more sustainable use for this green space? How about an expanded campus garden? A sprinkling of native flowers and shrub beds? Ornamental grass? Clover? Moss?

x1ifm4,CAI DAO: Crypto + AI Club,"CAI: Crypto + AI

Crypto and AI are the two cutting-edge technologies that will shape our society in the coming years. And the people who have experience in research or development in both fields seem like they will be the center of the development of numerous ground breaking technologies and companies later on.

People who are just researching AI are very smart, however a lot of them tend to have a conventional worldview and follow an established path. Where as a lot of people just into crypto tend to lack fundamental skills and are just following what is hot at the moment.

Therefore we believe that the people who have been involved in both fields have both the technical abilities to build convoluted models and systems and also are willing to take risks, find and seize new market opportunities and do novel things.

Although these people will contribute greatly to shaping our society for many years, they might find it challenging to find peers who have interests in both areas. And we would like to invite those people to CAI.

These people tend to look for the latest breakthroughs, read papers, white papers and follow the leading figures in the field on Twitter, so there is no need to have a rigid program/curriculum for the club. We will just do our best to create the best environment for people to make friends, communicate with each other, share ideas, and hopefully collaborate on new projects.

After review an invitation to the discord server will be sent via email.

If you are interested, apply here.

x1v21y,Econ major in two years,"Hi guys, I know I'm supposed to ask my Columbia advisor about this, but I'm part of a dual ba program and I don't know who my advisor is yet. The dual ba requires two years at another university and another two at Columbia. Basically I'm worried about finishing my Columbia degree on time when I'm only on campus for two years.  I would still have to finish the three sems of science core, uw, the lit part of lithum, maybe one sem of global core, and art and music hum for the two years at Columbia. For the econ major requirements, I'm starting with Calc III for my math sequence, and I have to take everything else at Columbia. Which stems another question, I would like to go into consulting/finance after I graduate, so would financial econ be a better choice? Would financial econ take more time to finish than regular econ?

x3a4ru,Is it deceitful of me to say I go to Columbia if I am a TC student?,"\*\* Currently a little ill, so apologies for any typos or incoherence. I am out of it \*\*

I'm about to start my masters of science at TC  (the neuro program) and my family loves telling people I go to Columbia etc. Everyone thinks I'm super academically gifted and diligent yadi yadi yada. Not sure if this is imposters syndrome, but I just feel like a fraud if I say I go to Columbia. Hopefully, my inferiority complex isn't shining through. 

I mean, we don't even have access to the columbia contacts - only TC faculty/students. Our email is [tc.columbia.edu](https://tc.columbia.edu) , not [columbia.edu](https://columbia.edu) . Isn't it like someone from Barnard saying they go to columbia, instead of saying Barnard? I mean yes, you get a diploma from Columbia, but its a completely seperate admission process. 

Yes, I might go to 'Columbia'. But did I GET ACCEPTED to Columbia? Is TC's acceptance rate even close to the other colleges at Columbia? They sent us tuition costs for cross-registration and  Barnard isn't on it, so I'm assuming other colleges don't see TC either.

However, I wanted my broker to pick up my keys on my behalf in advance to give it to a friend who would help me settle ahead of my arrival. 

Now the real estate agency that represents the landlord absolutely REFUSES to give my keys to my broker to whom I delegated my rights to pick up the keys on my behalf. The agent is sending me very rude emails including words like ""Please stop asking. It is a no."" and when my broker emailed him regarding the liability aspect and that she could help with that since she is an attorney and can legally represent me, the agent plainly emailed both of us ""The answer is no.""

This sounds very rude and unprofessional to me, and I can't believe that I am being refused to get my keys to my place that I paid the rent and security deposit for.

When I worked for one of these apps before I came to grad school here, I was largely dependent on tips because the app only paid $2-3 per order. It was really frustrating to deliver food to fancy houses in multi-million dollar neighborhoods and receive no tip.

xcyypu,should i transfer to Columbia?,"hi guys. 

this year, i transferred to penn. honestly, i feel kinda miserable. the school is high pressure‚Äîboth academically and socially. 

academics bc ofc classes are gonna be hard but also because i feel like i'm at or below average now. I'm burnt out and it's hard to work as hard as last year, when I had a clear goal to transfer. socially bc there's this constant pressure of needing to go out, socialize, network, etc. literally everyone here parties from thursday to sunday. im sitting here on a monday night drunk as shit typing this up right now lmfao. i've been struggling with finding genuine friends here and i've been rejected by a bfrat and a few clubs already. while people here are still really nice, I feel as if I'm literally living in a different world than them‚Äîas if we're on different frequencies. 

I'm contemplating whether to shoot an app to Columbia again or not. it has always been my dream school. I asked this question here a while ago, but that was before I actually attended Penn. I think now that I've come to Penn, I need to make a decision between staying here, returning to my original college, or applying to Columbia again. 

however, i want to ask you guys whether it's any better at Columbia. i don't know if the struggles im dealing with is something that pervades every ivy league/top college or if it's unique to Penn. what do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/xcyypu/should_i_transfer_to_columbia/,Mr_Cuddlesz,1,2022-09-13 01:23:54,0,/r/columbia/comments/xcyypu/should_i_transfer_to_columbia/

I moved here recently for grad school. 

I was walking to campus today morning when a woman randomly hit me on the head and walked away.

I called public safety emergency and my call went to an answering machine.

I don't have any friends here, the only person I am sort of close with is one of my roommates. I feel so isolated and I miss my home country. I have been having some difficulty making friends here as well because I have become very shy and awkward these past 2.5 years.

xhy7k7,Appreciation Post: Columbia's Campus Plan,"Since Columbia lacks a general appreciation club for its architecture, I figured I would fill that void to showcase and discuss the historic campus. In envisioning the transformation from an insane asylum to a formidable academic institution, the school tapped the preeminent firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White in 1893 to design the master plan of Georgian Revival buildings laid out on axis to emphasize symmetry, geometry, and order. Charles M. McKim served as lead partner in the firm, contrasting Stanford White's design for New York University's Heights Camous around the same time. Each structure had a carefully-laid place on the campus and was intended to be in dialogue while still being somewhat similar in style. The McKim firm was especially attuned to the notion of harmony as to not overwhelm visually on what was in actuality an uneven plot of land. They intended for the principal campus buildings of a library, chapel, theater, refectory, and possibly a gymnasium be situated on the center of the grounds with classroom and residential buildings on the periphery.

To go along with the McKim masterplan, the Olmsted Brothers firm of Brookline, Massachusetts was tapped to formulate a master landscape plan for both the Columbia and Barnard campuses. Many open quadrangles were divided by a series of bounded courtyards. On 116th street, a set of seps led to an extremely shallow court. From this court, a set of five monumental arches led to a form a sort of propylaea to the Acropolis as a grand classically-inspired entry. The remainder of the campus reinforced a sense of separation, as a private space, from the rest of the city. Keen observers will note the open road on 116th Street. which remained open.

xi0h56,2nd Bachelor‚Äôs @ Columbia GS?,"Hey everyone,

I recently graduated from a top-3 LAC with an english degree. Though I finished with a 3.7 gpa, I‚Äôm struggling in today‚Äôs job market and now regret not studying something more technical.

I‚Äôm considering applying to Columbia GS for a 2nd bachelor‚Äôs in computer science. CS is something that began to interest me at the beginning of my junior year, but at that point it was too late to change majors.

For context, I‚Äôm 26 years old and have taken a couple of breaks in my educational path. I scored a 34 on the ACT. And I‚Äôm considering applying for spring 23 or fall 23 admission.

Is it too soon to consider pursuing a 2nd bachelor‚Äôs? Would it be best to give it some more time or just apply now and see what happens?

Any input is greatly appreciated! Feel free to comment or pm",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/xi0h56/2nd_bachelors_columbia_gs/,jockos_ears,1,2022-09-18 23:21:24,0,/r/columbia/comments/xi0h56/2nd_bachelors_columbia_gs/

Columbia Effective Altruism is running a wide variety of programs related to **AI safety** for people with advanced technical backgrounds and beginners! Please also share these programs with your friends who might be interested!!

* The ***AI Safety Fellowship*** is an 8-week discussion group focused on the problem of aligning advanced AI with human values. If you‚Äôre interested in learning about new research by OpenAI and DeepMind in deep reinforcement learning, cooperative inverse reinforcement learning, interpretable/transparent AI, AI policy, or care about making sure AI has a positive impact on the world, join the fellowship! Check out our [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h857AQT2dZiZ48cfGQEksLFUtnZSdtah2GLoJUnm0c8/edit)!

* The [Center for AI Safety](https://safe.ai/), partnering with Columbia EA, is announcing the ***Machine Learning Safety Scholars Program***, an 8-week \~5 hrs/week hybrid course that provides an introduction to empirical ML Safety research topics like robustness, monitoring, and alignment. [**Apply here**](https://airtable.com/shr465Etku3eqE0x3) by September 25th at 11:59 PM EST. The course is for students who already have a background in deep learning and is instructed by UC Berkeley PhD [Dan Hendrycks](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=czyretsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en). Stipends are available to remove any potential financial barriers. For more information visit the [course website](https://www.mlsafety.org/intro-to-ml-safety) and see the [curriculum](https://course.mlsafety.org/).
* Artificial intelligence is poised to be a radically transformative technology. As such, it is likely to bring wide-ranging challenges to tackle. and opportunities to seize. The ***AI Governance Fellowship*** investigates how we can shape the development and deployment of artificial intelligence to serve the common good and reduce existential risks from AI. Over the course of 8 weeks, we will examine the transformative potential of AI, delve into relevant actors and governance strategies, and investigate different career paths in the field.

* The ***AI Safety Research Program*** will involve small teams of students working on AI safety projects with supervision and guidance from an experienced AI safety researcher (e.g. independent researchers, PhD students, postdocs, etc.). This role would benefit from prior experience with machine learning, but our hope is that students willing to devote time to learning alongside the project will be able to perform this role without such a background.

xkrqs2,Appreciation Post: Buell Hall - Maison Fran√ßaise,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2nuicm52acp91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95dd999337098ece708745fe274b92d41763d80

Since Columbia lacks a general appreciation club for its architecture, I figured I would fill that void to showcase and discuss the historic campus through the lens of classical architecture. The oldest surviving structure on Columbia's campus is not actually from Columbia but predates the Morningside location (note that there are gates and other remnants installed which are older from earlier Columbia locations). In looking for a new home for the school, Columbia ended up building on the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum which was established in 1821. Along with the Leake &amp; Watts Orphan Asylum, the area between Bloomingdale and Manhattanville was basically home to mostly asylums with the occasional country mansion as this was truly seen as the countryside back in the day. 

https://preview.redd.it/3r29xh35acp91.png?width=1840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7c1b2924e4104001b2a0252c61c0ce03702cd4e

1885, Macy Villa was designed by Ralph S. Townsend as the final structure of the Bloomingdale campus for the Society of the New York Hospital which treated patients with mental disorders. In moving uptown, the patients were taken out of prisonlike basement quarters in their earlier site in Lower Manhattan to more humane buildings that were aesthetically pleasing. The building's funds were donated by William H. Macy who was a wealthy trustee of the hospital. The original plans showed a generously-sized dining room, a billiards room, and comfortable rooms for twelve patients.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/hiciwdlo9cp91.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a9c907890b4702da8086195589ea1f72486c116

By 1897, Columbia had begun to settle in and the building became known as College Hall as the resience of the Dean of the College. It was relocated in September of 1905 by being literally picked up and moved up the hill, closer to Low Library to make way for Kent Hall. This move ended up avoiding demolition but it also resulted in dramatic alterations like the loss of the porches. By 1935, the use had change to become the alumni house for all such affairs. It later became the first home of the School of General Studies in 1956.

https://preview.redd.it/4gmvugstacp91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bc98d726030677de7a367aed77d6a639288d873

In this building's latest iteration, it holds the Maison Fran√ßaise which was established in 1977 and the Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture which opened in 1990. What will the future hold for Buell Hall? One can only imagine it will continue to be adapted as needs change over the many more centuries of Columbia's existence.

xmdsc8,Mistake on common app/imposter syndrome," A friend of mine who was accepted last year had a mistake in his common app. His family education section wasn't filled out correctly, so it said that his parents graduated high/secondary school instead of graduate school.

However his parents both put down engineer as occupation, and listed the companies they worked for and the exact job title.

In this case, would the adcom write off the education section as a mistake? He's already started school and has been getting a lot of emails intended for first generation/low income students, and is worried the school accepted him on the basis of being first generation (which he doesn't self identify as, and didn't intend to present himself as). He even went to one of these events just to find the coordinator and tell them his situation. The coordinator apparently didn't do anything, and he still gets email invites to first generation/low income events. 

Anyways, he's has really strong imposter syndrome and thinks that he's not deserving of being here.

xnyevf,transferring to an ivy league,"  


Hi 

The title is pretty straightforward. 

I'm a freshman at Uni, and I wanted some advice. 

I don't have an EC's or huge internships so far... 

But I wanted to look for some that would make my portfolio strong. I was hoping to see from both transfers and alums in Columbia how they got their EC, Internships, etc. So I can have an idea of where to start. 

I am a Computer Science Major with a Minor in Art 

I have already started my application and am planning to transfer in my sophomore year. 

 I also wanted to know how many of you maintained an excellent high, standing GPA. Why did you choose Columbia? 

And if any of you have scholarships, where did you search for them, and what are some excellent tips to keep in mind when applying for a scholarship? And the same goes for good essay tips when applying to Columbia's ""Why transfer essay."" 

I'm having money problems so I will be leaving the Uni I am attending and going to Community College my spring semester of Freshman year, where I will also finish my sophomore year. 

Besides the financial stress it takes to attend this Uni (its a public state school), The only bad thing I can point out about my current Uni that will not make me go back after community college is that I don't like the food there (I dorm), so I've been missing breakfast and Lunch. Then I just eat something small for dinner. It has been affecting my school performance and affecting my mental health. My work study also isn't working out with my 17 credit hours. I can barely find any time to work because of how spread out my schedule is. Its campus is relatively small, which I don't like. 

The professors are great people, however... I love my classes. And I always attend office hours etc. The people here are friendly and kind. 

But that's probably my reason as to why I won't go back to that Uni once I finish Community College. 

I was hoping you could guide me in the right direction to make sure I make the most of the opportunities and do my best to be able to attend any Uni of my liking.   


So far my top choices are Columbia University (not attending SEAS) and the University of Southern California.

xu1fb8,Appreciation Post: Low Library (Pt. 1),"Since Columbia lacks a general appreciation club for its architecture, I will try to fill that void to showcase and discuss the historic campus through the lens of classicism. At the physical and spiritual center of the campus is Low Library, which was specifically-placed to take inspiration from the Library of Congress, British Museum Library, and the Radcliffe Camera at Oxford. Low Memorial Library was the first major building erected on Columbia's Morningside Heights home. It was named in memory of Abiel Abbot Low, following a donation of $1M (the equivalent to well over $30M in today's dollars) by Seth Low for its construction.

https://preview.redd.it/57jumshmngr91.png?width=1816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31d663ba4f737e46e33c7a5f66256ac92cda91c3

Charles F. McKim, as lead partner on the project in the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White, designed the building in 1895 as the main library of Columbia's burgeoning Morningside Heights campus. Looking to Europe for inspiration, he envisioned an octagonal shaped drum containing large semi-circular lunette windows, crowned by a low dome modeled on the Pantheon in Rome (the same exact dome scheme was used by McKim for the Agricultural Building at the 1893 World's Fair Exposition in Chicago). Unlike the intentional ephemeral nature of that groundbreaking fair, this was intended as a permanent manifestation of the school's prominence and stature. One of the chief features is an imposing Ionic portico, consisting of ten superb fluted columns, supporting a simple cornice and high attic story, inscribed with references to the original King's College charter.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/azntgby6rgr91.jpg?width=1319&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126186b0e4f2377fcf723162b2810bbfab681758

https://preview.redd.it/rlk1k9bjqgr91.png?width=1040&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0763a0c9cdab6496f8841cc029e48fa6e8160bba

Monumental in scale and in scope, Low Library was intricately planned by McKim along with Seth Low to ensure that the ensuing design would be a fitting memorial. Designed on a Greek cross plan, the Library is composed of a central, octagonal hall with upper galleries, ambulatory, four corner staircases, and the four projecting arms of the cross. The great hall served originally as the library's principal reading room, and was modeled after the main reading room of the British Museum in London. Three wings housed the library functions organized around a grand reading room. Both closed and open stacks were utilized, considered the most modern convention at the time.

https://preview.redd.it/i5wbcdqkrgr91.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df04ac26da9279ac7651cb54799d02d64f579f57

The exterior was composed of limestone with structural elements by the Guastavino Fireproof Tile Co. which provided the support for such an intricate vault. The building was planned to hold a capacity of 1.5 million books, along with offices of the administration. It was constructed by the Norcross Brothers, considered to be the finest builder in America at the time. In typical New York City fashion, such a novel design delayed issuance of a construction permit for several months while the buildings staff wrapped their head around how erect such a thing,

https://preview.redd.it/ehicyf45tgr91.jpg?width=2071&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9325eaf150fc40ff66ca9fe7cee75a2c25dbc7cc

While the capacity was second only to the Library of Congress at the time of building, it was only suited for the modest student enrollment of around 300 students in the school's early years. By 1920, the conditions had become so cramped that it was virtually paralyzing for operations and options were considered for a new facility. After Butler Library's completion in 1934, the building was transformed into the ceremonial and administrative center it remains today. A coming post will discuss the breathtaking interior and is many secrets. Stay tuned.

So now I'm just feeling extremely lost and terrified. Failing is really not an option for me (I know, I know‚Äîit's what everyone says, but I would honest to god be disowned and financially doomed if I didn't get credit for my classes or took more time off). Should I reach out to CPS and explain what I've been going through? Would they be able to make accommodations for me? I just don't know what to do and need support somehow.

xuxn18,I just got into Columbia GS for the Spring 2023! May I ask some questions regarding CS/Math/Stats at Columbia?,"I have done some research about majoring CS at Columbia and I have some questions.

1. Can undergrads majoring in computer science take 6000 level CS or STCS courses like Richard Zemel's Fair and Robust Algorithm or Zhou Yu's Conversational AI or David Blei's Foundations of graphical models or Carl Vondrick's representation learning etc? It seems these courses never get full even though the maximum capacity is only 40 students per class. Is it because they don't allow undergrads to take these classes or is it because undergrads and masters students avoid these classes because they are too hard? If they do allow some undergrads to take the class, is it hard to get the instructor's permission to take these classes?

   2. Would it be possible to join Elias Bareinboim, Richard Zemel, Zhou Yu or Carl Vondrick's lab as an undergrad? I am broadly interested in ML/NLP/CV but I want to work on the more theoretical side of ML during my PhD. Is the process of joining any of the four labs very competitive and would they require previous publications? I am worried since it seems CS department is overcrowded at Columbia... Would there be a way to join these labs even before I take classes at Columbia? I am only going to stay at Columbia for 2 and a half years and I want to get started asap.

3. Is professor Richard Zemel going to return to Toronto? His website indicates that he's on leave from UofT from 2021 to 2022 but his wife is also the professor at Columbia so I am not sure if he will return or not.. I really wanna take his classes.

4. I am coming with max credits and I am coming with a junior standing. I will declare CS during my first semester(Spring 2023) at Columbia. In this case, how soon can I take classes like Causal Inference I/Computer Vision II/6000 level classes? Can I take these classes during Fall 2023 as a junior CS major(since I will be a second semester junior)?

5. Is it possible to take MA only stats classes as an undergrad?

6. What CS classes would you recommend me taking for my first semester? I am going to take Modern Analysis I and Probability and Art/Music Hum for the first semester but I am not sure what CS class to take. Since I won't be declared until the middle of the semester, I won't be able to take much CS classes..

7. Based on my research, it seems there is no difference between SEAS and GS in terms of research opportunity in machine learning but I did see research opportunities that specifically mention ""SEAS-only"" [https://studentresearch.engineering.columbia.edu/content/concept-attribute-learning-position-filled](https://studentresearch.engineering.columbia.edu/content/concept-attribute-learning-position-filled) Would I be able to get the position or join the lab if I take the professor's class and do well and am willing to do the research assistance for free?

y0on60,Ever Get A Qualifier To Accommodations at ds,"Yeah, I have been stressed about  a class and what's been exacerbating it is the teacher is not allowing me extensions for my own benefit.

So I have been pretty frustrated as I'm kind of wasting a lot of time on work that I am not understanding due to deadlines. If it was clear I could get a deadline extension I could adjust my schedule to get help at office hrs.

&amp;#x200B;

So I met with DS and they told me I need to be in active therapy to get them to help me. This kind of worries me as it feels like they are not taking my word, and that question of autonomy is really frightening for me. 

I explained that my therapist stopped seeing me as I moved. I was working 70+ hrs over the summer, now I'm back going to school full-time with only twenty hrs two jobs.

I immediately reached out to CPS for a requisite ""psych check"", but I wanted to gauge whether or not this was normal procedure by asking others first.

I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôve gotten spoiled as I know this is how it‚Äôs been done prior to 2020 but the threat of falling so far behind in classes that you have to drop them because you miss a week or two of class due to being sick was basically non-existent last semester and I don‚Äôt think that was a bad thing.

y2t4py,Columbia turning me into a cynic.,"Sorry in advance. Just puking my thoughts out.  


When I came to this school, I had less self-awareness and smarts, but more energy, and more drive.  


For some reason, after years of spending time here, going through the initial highs, then covid, then back, I find myself slowly becoming unbothered by everything. As if the grade are just numbers on a page, this school's image is redundant, prestige is just a fa√ßade made by meagerly humans backed by some historical achievements of alumni that we have no connections with yet feel pride for. And none of this really matters the day after we graduate and leave.   


The fancy paintings at butler don't impress me. The people here don't inspire me. There's nothing really special about this place anymore. Not even the quality of education.   
Everyone here is drifting, I'm around people who study hard and get their achievements in but I feel like a lot of people do it because they can't escape their personality or have no real meaningful reason for being here other than they just applied and floated here because it was their best choice. I am speaking for undergraduates, including me.   


Maybe it's because during covid, I've experienced much more of life than I ever did beforehand. I used to feel magic and the gravitas. Not anymore. I just want to chill and explore the city now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/y2t4py/columbia_turning_me_into_a_cynic/,Funny_Treacle2874,1,2022-10-13 04:19:16,0,/r/columbia/comments/y2t4py/columbia_turning_me_into_a_cynic/

y6sile,how do you get a doctors note to give profs...,"title basically... I was homeschooled most of my life and then went to a boarding school with a health center that automatically sent illness excuses to teachers for me and then had no money and didn't go to any doctor ever for several years, so I am so confused about how one goes about getting a doctors note? especially for flare ups of chronic conditions if one doesn't have a regular provider? like do I just go to columbia's health center, will they actually write me a note if I say ""hi I'm having severe symptoms today of PTSD/chronic pain &amp; fatigue/etc."" or are they gonna be annoying about it because there's no test for it and ""it's all in your head and you're making it up to get out of class""? do I go to my primary care physician? do I just have no options until CPS decides to actually refer me to a specialist that can help me convince ODS I'm not faking and get me absence policy flexibility as an accommodation? I have columbia student insurance and also medicaid leftover from the summer, if that is relevant. I just feel like I'm wasting the physicians time by going in for a note... like I know what's wrong and I don't need medical care? I just apparently need a ""professional"" to verify that I am actually experiencing my experiences (because I am not enough of a ""professional"" in re: my own perceptions...)

y7fbpy,"How much ""red tape"" is there to work through when accessing resources at Barnard?","I'm a prospective transfer student, just looking for now but considering attending, and I'm just wondering how much bureaucratic red tape I might expect if I went to Barnard. By ""bureaucratic red tape"", I mean wait times for essential services, accessibility of resources, and the general level of administrative headache involved in completing a degree at the institution.

Some specific questions:

* If I needed to speak to an academic advisor about my class schedule for a given term or about my major/minor plans, how feasible would it be to get an appointment with them that same week (or even the next week)? Is the process straightforward?
*  If I wanted to secure academic accommodations for disabilities, how long would you say that process normally takes from the first step to the last?
*  If I needed to talk to someone in the financial aid office, how long would I typically need to wait for that or for FA issues to be resolved?
* If I needed a night safety escort to make sure I got home safely, what are the odds that the person/people tasked with that job would actually show up?

I'd be coming from UC Berkeley, notorious for its bureaucracy. I had to wait 9 months for a disability accommodation, meaning I had to do without for most of my first year. I was assaulted on campus after our night safety people never showed up to walk me home and I was hung up on when I tried to reach them. Our financial aid office didn't get back to me for five months about an issue that ultimately affected my credit and put me into debt unnecessarily (someone had entered my info wrong and I couldn't get through to anyone to correct it, despite countless calls/emails; I ultimately had to CC this person's boss before I got it fixed). Things like this are really common here, and I'm over it. I feel like I'm doing people's jobs for them, and doing all that on top of my courses is getting unmanageable. I honest-to-god spend more time putting out administrative fires than I do on my academics, and I definitely feel like it's possible not to have to fight for every little thing.

I love the idea of attending an all-women college that's attached to a large university like Columbia. It's all the benefits of a small LAC and an R1 research uni in one! Plus, I've been to the campus on a tour (many moons ago, but still) and it had this very cozy, dark academia vibe but everyone seemed really happy and passionate. Overall, it seems like it could be a better fit for me and my style, so I'm considering applying to transfer. Of course, though, I could be mistaken, which is why I'd like to learn more from students who are actually dealing with these things and not just the pretty brochures they send out. 

What can you tell me about the CU/Barnard partnership and the level of ""doing other people's jobs for them"" I'd be looking at on the administrative side of things for the next two years? I obviously don't want to enter a situation that's just as bad or worse than that at Berkeley, so that's why I'm trying to learn more about the culture. Hopefully, there's some good insight to be found through this. üòÖ

535 5th Ave #920, New York, NY 10017

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm a recent Columbia grad that‚Äôs been going to this clinic for about a year now. 

If you are on the Columbia insurance, or other qualifying insurance, they will treat you at no out of pocket cost. I go there at least once a week for everything from sports related injuries to stress and fatigue. I also just have a lot of fun going there and getting adjusted and massaged and stretched. Never paid a dime.

y9hoq0,[serious] Need help or advice," Hi all. This is going to be kind of a heavy post but I am in a bad situation and I‚Äôm trying to use any resources I have before things get worse.

I‚Äôm a rising junior (second semester sophomore) at GS and am in a really bad financial situation. Fortunately I got enough aid that, with federal student loans, all the school bills are covered for the year if I take twelve credits per semester. My plan was, while not really good, to take a private student loan out this year to cover rent and living. Since the end of spring semester, this has been our plan and mother said she would cosign for me, but suddenly this month has decided that she is not willing to do that anymore. Besides the loan, none of my family is willing to support me even a little during college. I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me.

I got an apartment with my SO over the summer, and they have basically been supporting me since, but I feel horrible about it. They are kind, generous, loving, and patient but I don‚Äôt want to ask them to do this for me, it‚Äôs not fair and I want to be a better partner and carry my weight. I have some credit card debt from moving over the summer, and already have a pretty large student loan from last year. I don‚Äôt have enough money to pay next month‚Äôs rent.

Basically I‚Äôm trying to figure out if it‚Äôs possible or realistic for me to stay at this school. I don‚Äôt think I can graduate on time if I only take 12 credits a semester, if I take more than that I will have to pay out of pocket, and I think summer is only barely covered as well. I really need some advice about what to do‚Äì if anyone is willing to share any stories of how they‚Äôre managing working and attending school please do. If the school has any resources I should try to take advantage of please let me know. I have no previous degrees or much work experience, and I‚Äôm really afraid I‚Äôve screwed up and am going to live a bad life because of these financial decisions.

It‚Äôs been a really terrible week. I‚Äôve been anxious, I feel like I am heading towards a full blown depression and or going to hurt myself. I can‚Äôt focus in class or on assignments, I bombed a midterm this week, and I‚Äôm writing the shittiest paper ever. I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to, no communication from my parents, I‚Äôm afraid of telling my partner. All because of money.

What kind of jobs would be willing to work with my strange student schedule? What is my best bet for getting a job? Basically I need to make money somehow. I need to figure something out but I really have no clue how to get out from under this. I probably need to transfer to a cheaper school but it fucking sucks to have so much student debt from Columbia but not even graduating with the degree. I don‚Äôt know what to do if anyone has any advice please share with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/y9hoq0/serious_need_help_or_advice/,wet_squid1,1,2022-10-20 22:47:53,0,/r/columbia/comments/y9hoq0/serious_need_help_or_advice/
